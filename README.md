# BibNotes Formatter

This plugin generates literaure notes from the source stored in your Zotero library, including both the metadata and the annotations that are stored within Zotero (extracted using the native PDF Reader or the Zotfile plugin). The plugin is designed to provide with different tools to customize the format of the literature notes, the formatting of the annotations, as well as to introduced a number of custom transformations to the text of these annotations.



## Commands
- **Create/Update Literature Note**: when you select this command you will be prompted to chose one of references from the library you have imported. If the reference has not been imported yet in the specified folder, a new note will be generated. If a note already exists, its content will be updated without over-writing the existing annotation (e.g. comments added manually from within Obsidian and block-references will not be over-written). The first option ("Entire Library") can be selected to create/update all the notes from the imported library.
- **Update Library**: when you select this command, the plugin will generate/update all the notes that have been modified from Zotero since the last time the same command was selected. If this is the first time that you select this command, then the plugin will create/update literature notes for all the entries in the imported bibliography.

## Importing Zotero Library into Obsidian
In order to import your references and notes from Zotero, you need to export your library as a "BetterBibTex JSON" format and save this file inside your vualt. To do to follow these steps:
- install within Zotero the plugin ["Better BibTex for Zotero"](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/). For more information on how to install the plugin see the instructions on the [website of the plugin](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/installation/).
- in the main menu of Zotero go to File > Export Library (to export the entire library). It is also possible to to export a specific collection or group of references by selecting these, right-click, and then selecting "export collection" (in the case of a folder) or "export items" (in the case of a collection of references.
- select the export format "**BetterBibTex Json**". 
- select "Export Notes" if you would like to import into Obsidian the annotation. 
- *(Optional)* select "Keep updated" to automatically update the exported library once an entry is added/deleted/amended
- save the BetterBibTex JSON file in a folder **within** your Obsidian Vault
- in the plugin settings within Obsidian add the relative path within your vault of the library to be imported, as well as the relative path within your vault of the folder where you would like the literature notes to be stored.

## Create Literature Notes
By default the plugin will export both the metadata and the notes stored in Zotero for the selected reference. Both can be deselected in the plugin settings. The main configurations related to the format of the notes are the following:
- **Export Path**: in the plugin settings, add the relative folder within your Obsidian vault where the literature notes will be stored. In the field is left empty, the notes will be exported in the main folder. 
- **Note Title**: In the plugin setting you can specify the format of the note title. Possible values include: 
    - {{citeKey}}, 
    - {{title}},
