  abstract = {The institutions of global governance have changed dramatically in recent years. New organizational forms\textemdash including informal institutions, transgovernmental networks, and private transnational regulatory organizations (PTROs)\textemdash have expanded rapidly, while the growth of formal intergovernmental organizations has slowed. Organizational ecology provides an insightful framework for understanding these changing patterns of growth. Organizational ecology is primarily a structural theory, emphasizing the influence of institutional environments, especially their organizational density and resource availability, on organizational behavior and viability. To demonstrate the explanatory value of organizational ecology, we analyze the proliferation of PTROs compared with the relative stasis of intergovernmental organizations (IGOs). Continued growth of IGOs is constrained by crowding in their dense institutional environment, but PTROs benefit from organizational flexibility and low entry costs, which allow them to enter ``niches'' with limited resource competition. We probe the plausibility of our analysis by examining contemporary climate governance.},

``Multilateral treaties also \\
multiplied; environmental agreements, for example, grew by nearly 150 percent \\
during the 1990s.1 In the early years of this century, however, growth in the \\
number of IGOs has slowed markedly. Although existing IGOs continue to expand \\
their activities, the formation of new organizations has decreased by about 20 \\
percent.2 Adoption of new environmental treaties has slowed even more sharply'' \\
(Abbott et al., 2016, p. 247)
\par
``New organizational forms, in contrast, have emerged and expanded rapidly. States \\
have created informal institutions4 and plurilateral ``clubs,''5 such as the G20 and \\
other ``G-groups.'' In response to increasing institutional fragmentation, states have \\
also established meta-institutions to coordinate other entities, such as the High \\

``What accounts for this shift in the composition of global governance institutions? \\
Why do some types of organizations\textemdash such as PTROs\textemdash rapidly increase in number, \\
becoming a major, ongoing presence in global governance? And why do other or- \\
ganizational forms\textemdash such as IGOs\textemdash experience slowing growth, even as incumbent \\
organizations take on new responsibilities? In short, what explains the different pat- \\
terns of growth these organizational forms have experienced? Current theories of in- \\
ternational governance provide valuable insights and focus usefully on variations in \\
the characteristics of organizational actors. However, they overlook the other crucial \\
causal variable: the structure of the institutional environments that influence organi- \\
zational behavior'' \\

organizations engaged in similar activities and with similar patterns of resource \\
utilization.''62'' \\

``Finally, organizational density is a central feature in organizational ecology \\
because organizations must compete more vigorously for resources in a dense popu- \\
lation than in a sparse one. In natural ecologies, the density of a species is understood \\
as ``the number of individuals divided by the area occupied.''69'' \\

``We therefore adopt a different understanding of density. The numerator represents \\
the extent and complexity of governance activities within a population of organiza- \\
tions; numbers are relevant but not determinative. The denominator represents the re- \\
sources available for that population. Both factors are subject to change. To be sure, \\
this mutability presents significant measurement challenges. In principle, however, \\
one can observe the density of a population, compare its density over time, and \\
compare it with other populations'' \\

  abstract = {Global change and governance scholars frequently highlight polycentricity as a feature of resilient governance, but both theoretical and empirical knowledge about features and outcomes of the concept are lacking at the global scale. Here we investigate the structural properties of governance of global nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles, two processes in the `planetary boundaries' framework. We have used a mixed-methods approach to institutional analysis, integrating polycentric theory with social network theory in environmental policy and legal studies. We include an actor collaboration case study, the Global Partnership on Nutrient Management (GPNM), to explore governance challenges associated with global N and P cycles. We set the scope for selection of relevant legal instruments using an overview of global N and P flows between Earth system `components' (land, water, atmosphere, oceans, biosphere) and the major anthropogenic N and P perturbations. Our network analysis of citations of global N and P governance exposes the structural patterns of a loose network among the principal institutions and actors, in which legal instruments of the European Union serve as key cross-scale and cross-sectoral `gateways'. We show that the current international regimes in place for regulating N- and P-related issues represent a gap in governance at the global level. In addition, we are able to show that the emergence of GPNM provides synergies in this context of insufficient governance. The GPNM can be viewed as a structure of polycentric governance as it involves deliberate attempts for mutual adjustments and self-organised action.},

``scholars in both research areas (Braman, 2002; Melkote, 2002) have recently acknowledged that an examination of regimes and networks including both IGOs and international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) is instrumental in understanding international communication and development. The primary difference between IGOs and INGOs is that IGOs are established by international agreement among nations and INGOs are not (Jordan, Archer, Granger, \& Ordes, 2001). Despite their differences, IGOs and INGOs have increasingly collaborated in the production and delivery of social services (Longoria, 2005). Such increasing collaboration or partnerships between IGOs and INGOs reflect a growing interdependence\textemdash or an acknowledgment of the growing interdependence\textemdash between civil society organizations and governmental organizations (Kim \& Barnett, 2007).''

``Although prior research has operationalized centralization based upon the distribution of the number of ties that actors receive, with a small percentage of actors receiving a greater number of links (Doerfel \& Taylor, 2004), this research defines centralization as the propensity in the network for organizations to receive ties from other actors who do not have direct ties with one another,or the presence of k-in-stars.''

Because this network is a collaboration network between development organizations, the existence of ties between two nodes indicates the existence of collaboration between those two organizations. The direction of the tie indicates the direction of the collaboration between the two organizations. Reciprocal ties between two organizations suggest that both report using each other to achieve their respective objectives. In other words, reciprocal ties between two organizations signified that both report or recognize each other as instrumental in the achievement of their respective objectives. A unidirectional tie suggests that one organization reports collaborating with the other to achieve its own objectives. Thus, the direction of the tie represents or signals an acknowledgment by the focal organization (sender) that the partner organization (receiver of the tie) is instrumental in the achievement of its objectives.''

AKT-TDU triangles are scalable triangles, where k is estimated via simulation. Centralization was measured as the presence of higher order in-star parameter, referred to as a k-in-star2 (Robins, Snijders, et al., 2007). The k-in-star network structure is also scalable.''

``organizations that may be perceived as leaders in achieving collective action. This research makes four contributions to current theory and research about interorganizational networks. First, this study expands the current research on INGO interorganizational networks (Doerfel \& Taylor, 2004; Shumate et al., 2005; Taylor \& Doerfel, 2003), by expanding the issue network to include IGOs. Although Stohl and Stohl (2005) suggested such a move when examining the human rights network, most research to date has focused exclusively on the domain of INGOs. Second, this research expands the issue domains of interorganizational communication research to development networks. Third, this research examines the impact of both attributes and multiple levels of influences on the interorganizational network.

``INTRODUCTION'' (Ban et al., 2016, p. 1)  \#\#
\par
``The existing literature in International Political Economy tells us that regulators and their networks of experts should rush to establish authority over technically complex issues in global governance (B\texteuro{} uthe and Mattli 2011; Lall 2014). We also know that state, private sector, and civil groups are active in propagating expert networks on financial issues (Kastner 2014; Newman and Posner 2016). Critical in this regard is `issue control' or who has the right to speak with authority on a given issue of the regulatory agenda (Henriksen and Seabrooke 2016; Seabrooke and Henriksen, 2017). Issue control is important for professional and organizational networks and does not simply rely on organizational mandates and agenda setting. This concept is particularly important in the world of financial regulation, whose extreme technical complexity and exposure grants a privileged place to the `grey matter' of prominent experts (Baker 2013;M\texteuro{} ugge and Perry 2014; Seabrooke and Tsingou 2014). As such we need to know more about the environment in which knowledge about shadow banking regulation is produced.'' (Ban et al., 2016, p. 2)
\par
``This article addresses this gap by focusing on what kind of expertise has been mobilized by these IOs and how their expertise relates to knowledge deployed by competing actors, such as economists, lawyers, central bankers, and private sector practitioners.'' (Ban et al., 2016, p. 2)
\par
``The shadow banking regulatory agenda has been managed by the BIS, FSB, and IMF staff, who asserted issue control by drawing on research provided by the Fed and a handful of economists based in elite universities. The IOs left outside this epistemic policy community have little influence, as do legal scholars and economists with substantial private sector experience but no affiliation to elite academic or policy institutions. We show that the strategies the IO staff deployed to assert issue control have been IO-specific. The BIS relied on its reputation for practical experience with systemic risk issues as part of what we identify as a status strategy. The FSB used a measurement strategy to make the most of its authority over definitions and data. The IMF called on its macroeconomics expertise as part of a mandate strategy. Jointly deployed, these complementary strategies produced a self-referential and piecemeal reform agenda.'' (Ban et al., 2016, p. 3)

Network analysis visualizes the linkages between these reports and their institutional suppliers of expertise based on the professional affiliations of the authors cited by IOs. Prosopographic methods trace the career histories of the experts involved and how their trajectories (paths to seniority) and career experience differ (see Seabrooke and Nilsson 2015).''

``CONCLUSIONS'' (Ban et al., 2016, p. 25)  \#\#
\par
``there is overwhelming evidence that the thinking of the emerging global regulatory regime on this issue is shaped most extensively by IO staff that sit at the core. With the exception of the Fed, all other actors (academic economists, legal scholars, private sector experts) have been allowed to join the debate on a very selective basis.'' (Ban et al., 2016, p. 25)
\par
``Moreover, the academic economists that had potential influence on IO staff came from business schools not economics departments and their role as knowledge brokers between IOs is a reflection of their professional culture and incentives rather than the prestige of their employing institution.'' (Ban et al., 2016, p. 25)
\par
``The finding regarding IO staff dominance does not reinforce the view that IOs can be studied in isolation, as some kind of professional silos. Rather, our findings highlight how even IO staff working on highly technical issues like shadow banking call on outside expert networks, and other IO staff, to assert the authority of their expertise on an issue. We suggest that professional fields operate as `linked ecologies', with experts using connections between IOs, academia, think tanks, and domestic regulatory institutions to substantiate their claims to expertise. Professionals then fight over issue control, calling upon their preferred professional and organizational networks to do so. This article contributes to a growing body of work maps professional competition among transnational and supranational policy elites (Lebaron 2013; Mudge and Vauchez 2016; Seabrooke and Wigan 2016).''

  abstract = {This article examines to what extent regulatory import (RI), a common, but understudied mode of governance in regime complexes, was a separate factor of the global financial crisis in 2008. RI describes a specific mode of governance that occurs when regulators explicitly incorporate functionally important governance from an external forum to their own regulations, thus making their own performance dependent on external agency. While RI is associated with benefits, such as specialisation, it could cause unintended consequences. The one-sided dependence on external authority could result in the import of non-complementary governance or regulatory failures and undermine the regulator's performance. We illustrate our argument with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision that imported governance authority from the International Accounting Standards Board and credit rating agencies. The paper finds two negative consequences of RI for the Basel Committee's regulatory performance in the 2008 financial crisis. First, uncoordinated changes of accounting rules increased pro-cyclical effects that exacerbated the banking crisis. Second, import of credit risk measurement from credit rating agencies led to misjudgement of risk exposure.},

Introduction

\par
-  "This article addresses this gap by theorising the unintended consequences of RI. Connecting core ideas of the indirect governance and regime complex literature, we argue that regulators cannot fully anticipate the consequences of RI due to the dynamics in external forums. We identify two mechanisms of how RI can trigger disruptive interactions that undermine the regulator's performance. First, external actors can reform policies to achieve their sub-goal more efficiently, thus abolishing complementarities and triggering negative effects on the regulator. Second, the external forum can be characterised by non-functional governance, resulting in the import of governance failures."

First, uncoordinated policy changes in the IASB" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PEMAX962?page=3}{Becker and Linder 2021:250})

A theory of regulatory import (RI)

\par
-  "Furthermore, RI is conceptually distinct from sectoral specialisation (Gehring \& Faude, 2014), which describes a different mode of division of labour in regime complexes. Sectoral specialisation exists when one institution retreats completely from an area of functional overlap with the effect that'all institutions involved can govern their respective domains independently from each other' (Gehring \& Faude, 2014, p. 480). Thus, by transforming overlapping to parallel institutions (Alter \& Meunier, 2009, p. 15), sectoral specialisation will suspend inter-institutional dependencies and interactions among them instead of creating a one-sided dependency towards external agency."

The Basel Accord's import and its unintended consequences

\par
-  "The BCBS' import of accounting and credit risk measurement constitute two typical cases that systematically demonstrate the essential vulnerabilities in RI situations. In this regard, the cases fulfil three important characteristics: First, the BCBS externalised sub-issues, accounting and credit risk measurement, that are of functional importance for its objective of global banking stability. Second, it established a one-sided dependence on external forums since the performance of banking regulation is dependent on accounting and credit risk measurement but not vice versa. Third, the BCBS has limited control mechanisms to influence governance in the IASB and CRAs, leaving them autonomy for inconsiderate behaviour."

-  "In this section, we show how the BCBS's reliance on external accounting and credit risk measurement increased the pro-cyclicality of the Basel regulations and, thus, acted as a crisis multiplier. Wefirst show how functional changes in accounting standards affected the impact of banking regulations. Then we trace the effects of rating failures of private CRAs on Basel. In the third part, we will explain how the individual pro-cyclical effects of the twofold import unintentionally interacted during the 2008financial crisis and further exacerbated the pro-cyclicality of banking regulation by stalling interbank lending and destabilising the banking sector."

Uncoordinated policy change in the IASB

\par
-  "The shift to FVA by the IASB was issue-specific to accounting and an effort to increase transparency offinancial statements. Thus, the policy change by the IASB followed a functional logic towards the objective of the specific sub-issue, but it did not pay enough attention to its caused effects on the broader complex of internationalfinancial stability. As a result, the reliance of the BCBS on the IASB created the problem of external insulation in the pre-crisis phase, since the accounting experts of the IASB did not consider unintended consequences for banking regulation (see also M\"ugge \& Stellinga, 2015)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PEMAX962?page=12}{Becker and Linder 2021:259})

\par
-  "There are indications that the IASB was too insulated, causing experts to pursue accounting objectives without considering the effects for the overlapping BCBS (IMF, 2008, p. XIV). This becomes evident if we investigate the post-crisis reforms. First, the BCBS became an observer in the IFRSF Monitoring Board and a member in the IFRS Advisory Council. The Monitoring Board is a public oversight organ that was only introduced in 2009 after it became evident that the IFRSF was too powerful and relevant in globalfinancial regulation to be left unchecked. Before that, the IFRSF was completely private from its reconstitution in 2001 until 2009, which was the time-period when the disputed IAS 39 was in effect. The Advisory Council assists the IASB in policymaking. Thus, the Council gave the BCBS a possibility to sensitise the IASB for issues that are relevant for banking regulation. In return, the BCBS realised its vulnerability towards policy changes in external accounting for its own performance and founded the Accounting Experts Group (AEG). The AEG is a committee that serves as a forum for policy exchange between the BCBS and the IASB in order to avoid future coordination problems. Lastly, both institutions agreed upon a memorandum of understanding in 2017, where they mutually acknowledged the legitimacy and authority of each other and formalise their cooperation.3" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PEMAX962?page=15}{Becker and Linder 2021:262})

  abstract = {Research on interaction among international organizations has identified several factors limiting the effectiveness of cooperation. This article discusses an institutional design factor prevalent in all cooperation projects: the dual consensus rule. It implies that cooperation can only proceed when consensus has been reached both within and among organizations. The article argues that the dual consensus rule is induced by the autonomy-maximizing approach of member states and international bureaucracies. The dual consensus rule acts like a narrow filter, allowing only those aggregated preferences that all actors can agree on to turn into joint decisions. Given the large amount of potential veto players when two or more organizations interact, dysfunctions might easily arise, in particular when preferences strongly diverge and some intransigent outliers block cooperation. The resulting cooperation failure invites strategies ranging from bypassing to outright unilateralism. The article advocates a modification of the dual consensus rule in the early institutional design phase of cooperation when this effectiveness-control dilemma becomes evident. The theoretical framework is tested by tracing the causes of cooperation failure in two cases: EU\textendash NATO cooperation since 1999 and UN\textendash NATO cooperation in Bosnia 1993\textendash 95.},

``I distinguish four intensity levels (modifying Biermann 2008:  \\

often involving ambitious projects with shared responsibility and division of labor. Coopera- \\
tion is moderate when partners engage in joint decision-making but exclude essential issues.  \\
Cooperation of this level experiences ups and downs such as serious delays in decision- \\
making. Cooperation is minimal when joint decisions are rare or nonexistent and cooperation  \\
is largely confined to occasional representation in joint meetings and inconsistent sharing of  \\
basic information. Cooperation is absent when partners who would profit from cooperation  \\

\par
``When considering whether and how much to cooperate with another organization, member  \\
states and international bureaucracies have to reconcile potentially conflicting goals. The aim  \\
to solve problems jointly might conflict with the self-referential interest to guard one's own  \\
autonomy against loss of control. Autonomy concerns, defined here as ``to be not under the  \\
control of others,'' are widely discussed in the literature on cooperation (Haftel and Thomp- \\
son 2006: 255\textendash 56, referencing Robert Dahl). On the state level, realists, as well as ratio- \\
nal institutionalists claim that states strive to retain their autonomy in an anarchic, self-help  \\
system in order to avoid the ``vulnerability that high interdependence entails'' (Waltz 1979:  \\
106; also Keohane and Nye 1977). On the intra-organizational level, principal-agent schol- \\
ars discuss how member states (the principals) guard their decision-making autonomy within  \\
international organizations by employing multiple mechanisms to control the international  \\
bureaucracies (their agents) and prevent agency slack (Hawkins et al., 2006). Institutional con- \\
structivists argue that international bureaucracies pursue their own autonomous preferences  \\
and agendas by diffusing norms and fixing meanings (Barnett and Finnemore 1999, 2004).'' \\

\par
``Thus, it is not surprising that autonomy concerns loom large also in the literature on  \\
cooperation among international organizations (see Barnett and Coleman 2005; Gerspacher  \\
and Dupont 2007). Biermann (2008: 158\textendash 61) observes that organizations frequently avoid  \\
cooperation, because it entails compromising autonomy, i.e., adjusting to the preferences of  \\
partners. This confirms the findings of organization theory, which argues that organizations  \\
prefer ``not be become involved'' in inter-organizational cooperation unless they face strong  \\
incentives to do so (Van de Ven 1976: 28). Consequently, ``the structure of inclusive decision- \\
making is customarily very weak, with a minimum of authority, a high salience for self- \\
orientation among parties, and a consequent difficulty in making concerted decisions'' (Ibid.:  \\
26, quoting Warren Roland; also Galaskiewicz 1985; but see Oliver 1991).'' \\

voting is avoided; informal consensus building is the rule. The resulting dual consensus rule  \\
implies that cooperation can only proceed when consensus has been reached both within and  \\
among organizations. Therefore, the dual consensus rule structures decision-making among  \\
organizations, limits the intensity of cooperation to what is agreeable to all, and impacts the  \\
capacity of organizations to solve problems jointly'' \\
(Biermann, 2015, p. 48)
\par
``Since the mid-1960s, the consensus rule has gained prominence in international gover- \\
nance as a norm inspiring inclusive and participatory decision-making. It has three advan- \\
tages. First, it protects state sovereignty and, thus, prioritizes member-state control. In contrast  \\
to majority rule, which allows outvoting, states are not bound against their will. The egalitar- \\
ian thrust of consensus rule is especially valued by less powerful members. Second, consensus  \\
rule ensures broad-based support for decisions by enhancing their legitimacy\textemdash this stimulates  \\
compliance. Third, compared to unanimity rule, the absence of formal voting and the lower  \\
degrees of support necessary facilitate consensus-building. Advocates portray the consensus  \\
rule as the smart middle ground that avoids both the inefficiencies of unanimity rule and the  \\
legitimacy problems of majority rule.'' \\
(Biermann, 2015, p. 48)
\par
``A veto player is ``an individual or a collective actor whose agreement is required for a  \\
policy decision''; she can ``block the adoption of a policy'' (Tsebelis 1995: 293, 305).4 Within  \\
and among organizations, member states are the major veto players; further veto players might  \\
exist within member states. International bureaucracies may become de facto veto players.  \\
However, the willingness of the veto players to cooperate and compromise depends on the  \\
overall preference distribution, in particular on three factors: the number of potential veto  \\
players, the extent of preference heterogeneity, and individual preference intensity'' \\
(Biermann, 2015, p. 49)
\par
``Reaching joint decisions under the dual consensus rule is challenging. One other fac- \\
tor further complicates preference aggregation. It is the multilevel, bottom-up mode of  \\
inter-organizational decision-making, which is organized like a Russian doll. First, domestic  \\
actors have to agree on a national position, governments within each organization have to consent,  \\
and then an issue can be decided among partner organizations. Even though bargaining is often  \\
not sequential, the inter-organizational level is hostage to prior agreement on the other levels.  \\
The dual consensus rule poses an effectiveness-control dilemma: it maximizes member-state  \\
control and legitimizes joint decisions but risks undermining the effectiveness of cooperation.  \\
It is particularly severe when the number of potential veto players is large, preferences diverge  \\
strongly, and some veto players are unwilling to compromise.'' \\

``This article has tried to understand the causal impact of the dual consensus rule on the intensity  \\
of cooperation among international governmental organizations. It has argued that this rule  \\
gains prominence when preferences on cooperation are aggregated in the process of collective  \\
bargaining, coalition-building, and decision-making within and among organizations. The dual  \\
consensus rule filters aggregated preferences and co-determines whether and how much to coop- \\
erate. Only those preferences that all decision-makers agree on turn into inter-organizational  \\
decisions on cooperation. More specifically, it is the interplay of the dual consensus rule and  \\
the specific preference distribution within and among organizations that constrains and enables  \\
cooperation. Preference distribution has three components: The number of potential veto play- \\
ers, the extent of preference heterogeneity, and the preference intensity, especially of those  \\
pursuing outlier preferences.'' \\

  abstract = {This article combines inductive and deductive theory building to identify building blocks for a theory of inter-organizational networking, a phenomenon that has gained prominence in international relations, but is largely neglected by IR scholars. Organizational and network theory are identified as the major starting points for theory building. Hypotheses are generated from the network of Euro-Atlantic security institutions, which has become the most sophisticated network of its kind since the early 1990s. The article looks specifically at the genesis of dyadic inter-organizational relations and of entire networks, at the relevance of networking for policy output and at the system effects that networks have on individual organizations. The theoretical findings are presented so as to allow a transfer to other geographical and functional areas of networking. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

``Introduction'' (Breen et al., 2020, p. 419)  \#\#
\par
``Incoherence occurs when the elemental components of a regime complex \textendash{} typically, but not exclusively, international institutions \textendash{} produce `multiple, possibly mutually contradictory, sets of regulations' (Gehring and Faude, 2014) that impose conflicting obligations on member states. Incoherence is problematic from both a systemic and individual state perspective. For instance, the existence of multiple international provisions provide state actors with forum shopping opportunities to escape regulation or obtain a favorable outcome (Alter and Meunier, 2009; Gomez-Mera and Molinari, 2014), thus threatening the credibility of international regimes (Drezner, 2009) and the effectiveness of international cooperation (Gehring and Faude, 2014). Furthermore, the existence of multiple international obligations may interfere in domestic political battles, by providing policy entrepreneurs new political resources for influencing and opening up domestic fights (Newmann and Posner, 2018).''

``In this article, we investigate the extent of \textendash{} and factors driving \textendash{} incoherence between two key players in the regime complex surrounding international economic surveillance: the IMF and the EU.'' (Breen et al., 2020, p. 420)

``A major methodological innovation of this paper is to use sentiment analysis to measure incoherence in a regime complex. A method of quantitative text analysis with hitherto underexploited potential for students of international relations, sentiment analysis is used to derive a simple standardized measure of the tone of over 400 IMF and EU surveillance documents for the same group of EU member states over the period 1997\textendash 2014. Analyzing these documents as a whole rather than the recommendations within them, we treat differences in the tone of the language used within as a useful proxy for measuring policy coherence. Positive tone indicates the validation of member states' economic policies, whereas a negative tone brings with it an obligation to alter the status quo, albeit the kind of `soft' obligation described by Simmons (2000) in her study of IMF surveillance.''

``On average, the IMF is found to be more pessimistic than the EU in its assessment of EU member states' economic policies. The IMF was also significantly more pessimistic than the EU before the global financial crisis but it was less pessimistic thereafter.'' (Breen et al., 2020, p. 420)

``I. The Problem of Incoherence in Regime Complexes'' (Breen et al., 2020, p. 421)  \#\#
\par
``The problem of incoherence, as we define it, describes a situation in which the constitutive elements of a regime complex impose conflicting obligations on the same member states'' (Breen et al., 2020, p. 421)
\par
``We consequently conceive of incoherence as a spectrum that runs from a situation in which obligations imposed by institutions differ to a situation in which they are incompatible. In the extreme case of incompatibility, an international institution imposes obligations that require member states not to implement the obligations imposed by other institutions. In all other cases of incoherence, conflicting obligations give rise to a situation where states choose, prioritize or balance among multiple courses of action.'' (Breen et al., 2020, p. 421)
\par
``Power Distribution'' (Breen et al., 2020, p. 421)  \#\#\#
\par
``Scholars of regime complexity assume that state power shapes the formation and persistence of regime complexes (Keohane and Victor, 2011: 8\textendash 9). We go a step further by conjecturing that differences in the distribution of power within a regime complex drive incoherence. Specifically, we expect states to be subject to differing obligations from the elemental components of a regime complex in cases where such states wield different degrees of power within these elemental components.'' (Breen et al., 2020, p. 421)
\par
``we expect a state that wields greater influence within one international institution than another will, all other things being equal, face more stringent obligations from the first than the second'' (Breen et al., 2020, p. 422)
\par
``Discretionary Authority'' (Breen et al., 2020, p. 422)  \#\#\#

``A second factor that may produce incoherence in a regime complex lies in the differing degrees of discretionary authority enjoyed by the elemental components of the regime.'' (Breen et al., 2020, p. 422)

``Different control mechanisms are thus expected to shape the agent's performance, with more specific and intrusive rules designed to minimize the agent's discretion and thus the probability of deviant behavior.'' (Breen et al., 2020, p. 422)

``Extending these insights to the case under investigation, it is thus plausible to expect that if two elemental components of the same regime complex differ in their level of discretion they are likely to differ in the obligations they place on states.'' (Breen et al., 2020, p. 422)
\par
``Power and design certainly do not exhaust the list of potential drivers of incoherence. For instance, a burgeoning literature has drawn attention to recruitment patterns and professional networks to explain the (different) behavior of international institutions (Seabrooke and Tsingou, 2014; Ban, 2015).''

``Our analysis equates differences in the tone of IMF and EU surveillance with differences in the degree of obligations imposed on member states and so policy incoherence.'' (Breen et al., 2020, p. 423)
\par
``When the IMF and EU believe that governments are implementing `good' policies, surveillance reports should contain less pessimistic language and, consequently, bring less pressure to change domestic economic policies. The corollary of this point is that pessimistic language places a higher degree of obligation on a state than positive language; whereas positive language validates the economic policies of the state under review, we contend, negative language implies that states must change their economic policies either because of bad policy choices or worsening economic conditions or both. Specifically, we compare PINs issued by the IMF Executive Board for the EU 15 between 1997 and 2014 with Council opinions on member states' stability programs during the same period. We focus on documents rather than recommendations contained within as this provides us with a richer view of surveillance documents. The combined corpus includes 442 cases (i.e. documents) and around 595,000 words.'' (Breen et al., 2020, p. 424)
\par
``Turning to the literature on the IMF, Fratzscher and Reynaud (2011) perform a content analysis of all PINs for a group of emerging markets over the period 1996\textendash 2007. Each document in this corpus is coded according to its `favorableness' towards national economic policies. Manual coding of a concept like favorableness, or indeed incoherence, can provide a rich picture of the obligations placed on member states but the methodology raises serious concerns about reliability, as one coder's view of what constitutes favorable may differ considerably from another's, especially in documents that cover multiple policy areas (Krippendorff, 2012: 267\textendash 329).''

``This article has examined the extent of \textendash{} and factors driving \textendash{} incoherence between two key players in the regime complex surrounding international economic surveillance: the IMF and the EU. Our findings based on a sentiment analysis of more than 400 surveillance documents between 1997 and 2014 \textendash{} points to the presence of incoherence in this regime complex. Our results show that the IMF was more pessimistic on average than the EU but that the EU was less pessimistic in it surveillance efforts before the global financial crisis hit and more so thereafter. Such incoherence is explained not by organizational politics but by technocratic rules. We find little evidence that differences in the distribution of power within the elemental components of this regime was decisive. Neither the IMF nor the EU treaded softly when dealing with economically or politically powerful states. Instead, our results point towards differences in discretionary authority as the key driver of incoherence. When the rules underpinning EU and IMF fiscal surveillance bite and reduce these institutions' room for discretion, each institution tends to be more pessimistic. But the two institutions are responding to different rules with differing degrees of intensity and from different starting points, leading to incoherent assessments of member states' economic policies.''

IOs instead directly combine resources and expertise to pursue their mandates in tandem.9 While pooling carries its own costs as IOs encounter friction when they work together, these are small relative to a permanent restriction of the scope of organizational activities. IOs might then pool resources both because it is relatively less costly than coordination and because it offers several benefits to them, since it prevents member states from forum shopping and allows IOs to leverage their comparative advantages.10 Pooling can involve financial resources (cofinancing) or information and expertise (information sharing)'' (Clark, 2021, p. 2) \% Definition of Pooling

  abstract = {In policy domains characterised by complexity, international organizations (IOs) with overlapping mandates and governance functions regularly interact in ways that have important implications for global governance. Yet the dynamics of IO interactions remain understudied. This article breaks new ground by building on the theoretical insights of organizational ecology to examine IO competition, cooperation, and adaptation in the domain of energy. Drawing on original empirical data, I consider three related hypotheses: (1) competition between IOs in the same population is likely to centre on material resources; (2) IOs are more likely to cooperate when they have a shared governance goal; and (3) individual IOs can adapt by changing their goals and boundaries. In considering these hypotheses, this article highlights the limits of the organizational ecology approach and the need to broaden it to account for the possibility that IOs do cooperate, and that individual IOs, such as the International Energy Agency, have the capacity to adapt to changes in their environment.},

In other words, the focus shifts from any one organization to the sea in which they swim.'' (Downie, 2021, p. 2)

While competition may be the dominant form of interaction between IOs in the same population, as organizational ecology assumes, a failure to permit the possibility of other forms of interaction, such as cooperation, risks tunnel vision. Insights from other variants of ecological theory can draw attention to forms of IO interactions in the periphery, broadening what our theoretical frameworks can see.''

However, I also illustrate that symbolic resources, namely legitimacy, are essential for IOs to secure funding in the first place. In other words, symbolic resources act as positive feedback loop for material resources.'' (Downie, 2021, p. 3)  \% Insights regarding what resoruces drive cooperation among institutions

``1. Theorising competition, cooperation, and adaptation'' (Downie, 2021, p. 4)  \#\#
\par
``One of the most promising avenues to consider IO interactions is organizational ecology. Organizational ecology developed out of organizational studies in the 1970s with a focus on populations of organizations, rather than individual organizations.23 According to this approach, a population refers to aggregates of organizations that are typically alike in some respect, with shared resource pools, which could include, for example, funding, expertise, or technology. By taking the population to be the unit of analysis, it naturally offers insights into how organizations relate to one another within a given population. In other words, organizational interactions. As noted, the central insight in ecological terms is that because organizations compete over scarce resources, competition will lead to the selection of the most competitive organizational type. Further, as the density of the population increases, typically measured as the number of organizations in a population, so too will the competition between organizations over the finite pool of resources.24 A consequence of these processes is that, much like in population biology, organizational selection is determined by changes in the environment. Put differently, populations adapt to their environment, but individual organizations are not considered to be adaptable.'' (Downie, 2021, p. 4)  \% Summary of organizational ecology

\par
``Accordingly, in what follows I identify three hypotheses that can be used to consider the dynamics of IO interactions in global energy governance. T'' (Downie, 2021, p. 5)
\par
``1.1. Competition between IOs working on global energy governance is likely to centre on material resources'' (Downie, 2021, p. 5)  \#\#\#
\par
``According to organizational ecology, competition is the principal form of interaction between organizations.31 This insight stems from the concept of the `fundamental niche'. A niche refers to the social, economic, and political conditions that can sustain organizations, or put differently, the common pool of resources that organizations depend on for their survival.32 If two populations rely on completely different resource pools, then their niches do not overlap and there will be little competition. If their niches do overlap because they rely on similar sets of resources, competition will follow. And, given that organizations of the same population will have almost identical niches, competition is almost certain.'' (Downie, 2021, p. 5)  \% Niches and inter-organization echology
\par
``It can be assumed safely, therefore, that IOs working on global energy governance in the same population or in different populations with niches that overlap will be likely to compete. The question then is what are the social, economic, and political conditions that sustain IOs as an organizational form'' (Downie, 2021, p. 5)
\par
``Scholars of IOs have demonstrated that IOs tend to rely on material resources and symbolic resources for their survival,34 or what others refer to as tangible and intangible resources.35 IOs need material resources, principally money, to carry out their tasks and pay for their programmes and staff. For most IOs their money is derived from two main sources: membership dues from member states, and voluntary contributions from states and other private sources. IOs also need symbolic resources. Typically this refers to legitimacy, such that members perceive them as legitimate, which is also important for securing material resources. If an IO is perceived as valuable by its members and the international community it will also be more likely to secure financial resources.'' (Downie, 2021, p. 5)  \% Type of resources that influence competition among international organizations
\par
``Competition for resources could manifest in different ways. For example, IOs could compete for governance mandates because of the financial resources they could bring, alongside the related exposure to the organization, increasing its legitimacy in the eyes of the international community. For some IOs new mandates offer the possibility of accessing new streams of voluntary contributions, which can be a welcome source of funding when membership fees cannot be increased. For the same reasons IOs could also compete to ensure that their voices are heard at key forums and that they have a means to influence global agendas and rules.39 In regime complexes where there is no formal hierarchy between institutions, it can also be expected that some organizations will compete to be the focal actor in a given policy domain, especially if new organizations threaten their role as the dominant actor.'' (Downie, 2021, p. 6)  \% Types of competition among international organizations in regime complexes
\par
``1.2. IOs are more likely to cooperate when they have a shared governance goal'' (Downie, 2021, p. 6)  \#\#\#
\par
``IOs are able to put aside competitive dynamics, even if temporarily, to cooperate. For example, IOs that are competitors may decide to cooperate on specific issues at a given point in time. Such cooperation can take the form of simple exchanges of information, or other resources, such as expertise or personnel. In other cases, it can involve more ambitious forms of joint planning, and the coordination of decision-making and implementation of activities. This can manifest in formal agreements between actors and the creation of joint bodies, or more informal instruments, such as MoUs, or the adoption of common definitions of the problem or principles of action.'' (Downie, 2021, p. 6)  \% Forms of cooperation among IOs
\par
``When actors share a common goal, be it a broad aspirational goal or one institutionalised with specific targets, cooperation is more likely.44 The chief reason for this is that cooperation can help to secure symbolic and material resources. In other words, cooperation can be associated with resource creation.'' (Downie, 2021, p. 6)  \% Cooperation is more likely when organizations share common goals
\par
``1.3. Individual IOs can adapt by changing their goals and boundaries'' (Downie, 2021, p. 7)  \#\#
\par
``First, organizations may seek to transform their goals. For example, IOs may seek to change their mandates to expand into new policy domains in which they have not previously been associated. Or, to persuade member states to delegate additional governance functions, which will not only help to raise their profile, but which could also be associated with additional funding. Second, IOs may seek to broaden their organizational boundaries. There are several strategies that could be employed. For instance, IOs may seek to expand their boundaries by bringing in new organizations, in the same way private firms engage in acquisitions, or by bringing in new member states.63 Similarly organizations could establish new organizational units within the structure of the organization that are associated with a broader mandate'' (Downie, 2021, p. 8)  \% Types of changes that are possible within an organization that may affect cooperation

``Three sources of data were used. First, in order to establish a list of potential candidates, I examined the results of eight different efforts to map global energy governance identified in a recent review of the literature.68 Second, this list was combined with a recent database that comprises all actors that have worked with the G20 on global energy issues over the last decade.69 Third, I drew on the qualitative data described below to supplement this list with additional organizations identified by energy officials. These three sources produced a preliminary list of 114 actors. I use the term `actors' here, because consistent with a considerable body of IO scholarship, I consider IOs as strategic actors that have some autonomy from member states to pursue their own goals and strategies.70'' (Downie, 2021, p. 9)  \% Methodology selected to identify the organizations that are part of the regime

``3. H1: Competition for material resources'' (Downie, 2021, p. 10)  \#\#
\par
``The first hypothesis advanced here is that competition between IOs working on global energy governance is likely to centre on material resources. Before turning to consider this hypothesis, the assumption on which it is based, namely that competition is a central form of interaction, was well founded. Indeed, when officials were probed on the dynamics of the interactions between IOs working on global energy issues the overwhelming theme was one of competition. As one put it `IOs are competing all the time',73 or as another stated `turf wars are a natural part of organizational behaviour'.74 And this is directly related to the fact that they are competing for the same set of resources, `there are only a small few donors ... so you have to prove your worth and uniqueness, which means you have to show that you are better than your collaborators'. 75 To a large extent, the competition between IOs concentrated on the need to secure funding. As one official explained IOs `are constantly trying to show their worth, constantly trying to prove their value in order to get funding'.76 Or as another official lamented: `all this resourcing is going to staff playing political games because we are all competing for funding'.77 However, the empirical data highlights that while competition did centre on material resources as the first hypothesis would expect, symbolic resources, namely legitimacy, were also essential for IOs to secure funding in the first place. In other words, symbolic resources act as positive feedback loop for material'' (Downie, 2021, p. 10)  \% Competition for material vs. symbolic resources among IOs
\par
``resources. The competition for funding underpinned by a need for legitimacy was manifest in several ways.'' (Downie, 2021, p. 11)  +
\par
``IOs worked to ensure that their voices were visible at key forums. For example, as the G20 has playedalargerroleinglobalenergygovernancesinceitwaselevatedtoaleaders' summit in 2008,'' (Downie, 2021, p. 11)  \% IOs seek visibility
\par
``Second, in the context of the G20 being a playground for competition, it was clear that many IOs, including the IEA, IRENA, OECD, SEforALL, and the World Bank, among others, were eager to seek out governance tasks associated with the G20 even if these were unfunded. This was because these activities could raise their profile among key states, and in turn boost their legitimacy in the eyes of the international community on issues ranging from energy efficiency to energy access, which would increase the likelihood of future funding.84 As an IO official explained: When you are making funding pitches to donors you also point to the fact that you are asked by the G20 to write a report or that your CEO was invited to give a talk at the G20. Those are used as evidence to funders.85'' (Downie, 2021, p. 12)  \% Organizations tie their activity to the G20 as a way to achieve legitimacy
\par
``Third, in regime complexes where there is no formal hierarchy between institutions, as is the case in the energy domain, IOs compete not just for specific governance tasks, but also to be the focal actor. This dynamic was confirmed by national officials, who pointed out that many of these IOs are `competing to be the global authority, they all want to be the best'.89 IO officials confirmed this too: `as long as there is competition for dollars ... organizations not only do their own work, but they try to do what are others are doing as well, so that they become the dominant organization'.90'' (Downie, 2021, p. 12)  \% IOs compete to be the focal actors
\par
``IO's work in this area was largely driven by competition for resources. In a changing international environment, these IOs recognised that their organizational survival partly depended on acquiring and maintaining symbolic resources, such that their members perceive them as legitimate, which the G20 work offered, and which in turn would positively impact their ability to secure funding.99 Officials from several IOs working on fossil fuel subsidies acknowledged that their organizations' desire to participate was directly related to the increased exposure that the G20 could provide.100 For example, officials from the IEA and World Bank noted the benefits of doing analytical work for the G20 because of the `political visibility' it provided, or as another put it, `it elevates their status and importance'.'' (Downie, 2021, p. 13)  \% Interaction with the G20 as source of legitimization
\par
``That is not to say there was no cooperation. In 2010 these four IOs \textendash{} World Bank, IEA, OECD, and OPEC \textendash{} authored a joint report for the G20 Toronto Summit, which provided more detailed information on subsidies, and further reports followed.102 Although there was disagreement over the contents of the joint reports, there appears to have been some cooperation with IOs sharing limited information and expertise.103 For instance, the IEA and the OECD had combined their models to run different scenarios on fossil fuel subsidies, which fed into the World Energy Outlooks published by the IEA.104 However, competition was never far from the surface. There were minor disputes between IO officials over who would lead the first report, which the World Bank succeeded in doing, before it was agreed that the leadership role would rotate between them.105 As one IO official argued, `there is quite a bit of competition between IOs about how many times the G20 countries asked them to do something'.106 As another stated:'' (Downie, 2021, p. 13)  \% Nice quotes on types of cooperation/competition amogn IOs in G20 agenda

``The second hypothesis advanced in this article is that IOs will be more likely to cooperate when they have a shared governance goal, despite the prevalence of competition. Almost unanimously respondents lamented the lack of cooperation between IOs working on global energy issues.116 As one IO official joked, `the politically correct answer is that we are all working together in a coordinated fashion',117 but as many were quick to acknowledge, this was not the case. Officials pointed out that although some IOs do have individual cooperative arrangements, there are no cooperative structures to facilitate cooperation between multiple IOs in the energy domain.118 Consistent with the hypothesis, officials argued that what appears to promote cooperation is the creation of a joint mission or shared goal'' (Downie, 2021, p. 14)
\par
``Drawing on the interview data, several specific characteristics associated with the SDGs appear to be related to cooperation. First, and consistent with the hypothesis, was the potential for resource creation. According to IO officials, the SDGs provided an opportunity to secure resources \textendash{} this was the glue. As one UN official stated `it is important for us to contribute to the SDG process as a UN agency, as it gives us some legitimacy'.122 Such sentiments were mirrored by other IOs, such as the OECD and the IEA. This was related to the belief that legitimacy is necessary for future funding.'' (Downie, 2021, p. 15)

``Conclusion'' (Downie, 2021, p. 19)
\par
``In relation to the first hypothesis, the evidence indicates that competition between IOs is likely to concentrate on material resources, such as funding. However, it also highlights that the reality is more nuanced than the first hypothesis implies, given that symbolic resources, such as an organization's legitimacy is necessary for attaining material support. In other words, symbolic resources act as positive feedback loop for funding. Competition was manifest in several ways, especially when IOs competed to perform the same governance function, such as estimating the size of global fossil fuel subsidies. Here IOs could not agree on common definitions of the problem, regularly refused to share information, and consistently sought to do work in ways that demonstrated their superiority to other IOs carrying out almost identical tasks'' (Downie, 2021, p. 20)
\par
``The second and third hypotheses show why it is necessary to broaden the organizational ecology approach. Contrary to a strict interpretation of organizational ecology, this analysis shows that cooperation between IOs in the same population is possible, and that it is more likely when IOs subscribe to a shared goal. In particular, it suggests that goals that are characterised by the potential for resource creation; goals that cannot be achieved individually; and or goals that produce organizational structures to facilitate their attainment are more likely to encourage cooperation than those that do not. This was highlighted by the role that the SDGs have had on this population of IOs, by precipitating a number of them to pause their competitive tendencies in light of a common mission'' (Downie, 2021, p. 20)},

The principle of deference\textemdash acceptance of another state's exercise of legal authority\textemdash is one mechanism to manage such jurisdictional conflicts. Despite the importance of deference in international law and cooperation, little is known about the causes of variation in its use. In this article, we develop a theory of deference that focuses on the role that domestic institutions and norms play in ensuring procedural and substantive fairness. We test this theory in an original data set concerning accession practices in the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction. Our findings offer considerable support for the idea that states evaluate partners on the likelihood that they can offer a fair legal process. Exploring empirically the efforts against parental child abduction, we offer a nuanced account of the link between domestic institutions and norms and international cooperation. This account suggests that greater attention should be paid to the use of deference as a mechanism to manage the conflicts posed by globalization.},

I further explore how ``order in complexity'' can emerge through bottom-up processes of adaptation in lieu of stateled reform. My analysis supports three theoretical claims: (1) states frequently refashion governance complexes ``top-down'' in order to reduce conflictual overlap; (2) ``topdown'' restructuring and ``bottom-up'' adaptation present alternative mechanisms for ordering relations among component institutions of GGCs; (3) these twin mechanisms ensure that GGCs tend to (re)produce elements of order over time\textendash albeit often temporarily.

-  "International agreements and international law have expanded rapidly over the past century with the result that many areas of global politics are today co-governed by multiple institutions whose membership and competences overlap. The resulting "fragmentation" of global governance has been widely depicted as a source of rule inconsistency, duplication, and jurisdictional conflict (Abbott et al. 2015; Raustiala and Victor 2004; Alter and Meunier 2009; Kelley 2009:62; Orsini et al. 2013:32). Many worry that institutional overlap invites states to engage in regime shifting or forum shopping, thereby undermining the integrity of international law (Drezner 2009; Benvenisti and Downs 2007; Raustiala 2012; Morse and Keohane 2014; Orsini et al. 2013). Yet, others take a more optimistic view in arguing that inconsistency and conflict are not inescapable outcomes of growing institutional density, but that stable elements of coordination and collaboration can emerge within complex governance systems through overt management or gradual adaptation (inter alia, Forman and Segaar 2006; Oberth\"ur and Stokke 2011; Gehring and Faude 2013, 2014; van Asselt and Zelli 2014; Henning 2017; Pratt 2018a)."

-  "I am not the first to observe that ongoing interactions among overlapping institutions can lead to stable divisions of labour through functional specialization or other forms of alia, decentralized adaptation (see, inter Aggarwal 1998; Oberth\"ur and Stokke 2011; Gehring and Faude 2013, 2014; Pratt 2018a). My account expands on existing studies, however, by pointing to the frequency of deliberate, top-down restructuring of complex governance architectures through treaty terminations, mergers, reforms and funding cuts aimed to rationalize institutional interactions. I present "top-down restructuring" and " bottom-up adaptation" as alternative mechanisms for ordering GGCs" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2YU3EQ?page=2}{Eilstrup-Sangiovanni 2021:2})

-  "A second rationale for studying institutional complexity in a historical perspective is that most GGCs do not follow a linear path towards ever-greater complexity and fragmentation but rather evolve through stages of lesser or greater institutional density, overlap and (dis)order. A central claim of this article is that processes of top-down restructuring and bottom-up adaptation tend\textemdash over time\textemdash to (re)produce elements of both local and system-wide order in GGCs. Nevertheless, "order" in open complex systems remains precarious as existing task-divisions and exchange relationships are frequently upset by exogenous shocks (e.g. from the emergence of new actors or technologies, or new policy priorities). Thus, GGCs tend to evolve through a pattern of " punctuated equilibrium" (Krasner 1984; Colgan et al. 2012) in which periodic shocks lead to growing fragmentation and disorder, only to be followed by periods of (re)consolidation via deliberate management or spontaneous adaptation. A longer historical timeframe allows me to explore how processes of disintegration and reintegration unfold over time and to identify conditions leading to stability and change in complex governance systems."

2 Ordering complex governance systems

\par
2.1 What does " order" in a complex governance system look like?

\par
-  "an " ordered" GGC is a governance system in which the rules and activities of separate institutions and agents offer complementary rather than conflicting policy instruments so that component institutions work\textemdash together or in parallel\textemdash towards solving joint problems (Ostrom 1990; Young 1994:110-11, 1996; Oberth\"ur and Stokke 2011; Keohane and Victor 2011:8; Oberth\"ur and Pozarowska 2013:104), and in which institutional exchange relationships are relatively stable. Such synergy may be achieved with or without coordination by a core institution to which most stakeholders belong. A "disordered" GGC, by contrast, is characterized by clashing agendas, incongruent governance procedures and unstable exchange relationships. Whereas institutions in an ordered complex are mutually reinforcing, disordered governance complexes have a zero-sum quality insofar as individual institutions detract from the ability of others to fulfil their goals."

\par
-  "I identify two sources of order in GGCs; task-differentiation and coordination or collaboration. Task-differentiation describes the extent to which institutions fulfil different functions or tasks (Child and Mansfield 1972). A high degree of task-differentiation reduces the potential for direct rule conflict or zero-sum competition for resources (Gehring and Faude 2013, 2014; Henning and Pratt 2020). Coordination refers to processes of information-sharing and mutual accommodation through which institutions harmonise their practices\textemdash formally or informally\textemdash while collaboration implies that institutions engage in exchange or pooling of resources. A high degree of collaboration reduces overall demand for resources and introduces scale-economies." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2YU3EQ?page=6}{Eilstrup-Sangiovanni 2021:6})

2.2 Processes of ordering: Top-down v. bottom-up

\par
-  "States may purposefully engineer institutional overlap to enable forum shopping (Raustiala and Victor 2004:301; Helfer 2009; Morse and Keohane 2014), or to reduce the clarity of legal obligations (Benvenisti and Downs 2007; Alter and Meunier 2009). International organizations may deliberately expand their activities into the domain of others in order to influence their behaviour or capture "market shares" (Raustiala and Victor 2004:301; Betts 2013). Yet institutional overlap may also arise "accidentally" because policymakers have limited knowledge of prior agreements entered into by their predecessors (Mallard 2014:448), or due to the rise of private governance schemes beyond the control of states (Abbott et al. 2015)."

2.3 Top-down restructuring

\par
-  "Inconsistent rules may result in conflicting practices which undermine collective goals. Institutional proliferation may also weaken state oversight. Multiple institutions with poorly separated mandates make it harder for states to keep track of how resources are allocated and used, or to place responsibility for poor results. International organizations (whether public or private) may also suffer negative consequences from institutional complexity. Growing institutional density may trigger competition for scarce resources like state funding or expert staff. Jurisdictional overlap can also limit international organizations' ability to induce policy change, as opportunities for forum shopping allow states and other target actors to evade commitments (Cooley and Ron 2002; Pratt 2018b)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2YU3EQ?page=8}{Eilstrup-Sangiovanni 2021:8}) 

\par
-  "Another tool for reducing undesired overlap is institutional fusion whereby governments combine existing institutions through merger or by formally subordinating one institution to another." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FE2YU3EQ?page=8}{Eilstrup-Sangiovanni 2021:8})

\par

\par
-  "A second mechanism whereby governments may manage complexity (in addition to institutional dissolution and reform) is to create cross-cutting institutions tasked with coordinating the activities of separate governing bodies. Previous studies have pointed to the creation of "super-institutions" tasked with promoting governance coherence (Forman and Segaar 2006:211; Oberth\"ur and Stokke 2011:6). An example is the G20's Financial Stability Board which synchronises the work of national and international financial authorities. More broadly, informal fora like the G7 and the G20 often serve to coordinate the agendas of formal IGOs (Fioretos 2020; Vabulas and Snidal 2020; Westerwinter et al. 2020)."

2.4 Bottom-up adaptation

\par
-  "One bureaucratic response to growing institutional overlap might be to modify or reduce the scope of institutional activities to avoid direct competition with peers; a strategy of "avoidance" (see Bernholz 2009). Alternatively, weaker institutional agents may choose to defer to stronger peers by accepting their rules on issues where they are deemed more authoritative by virtue of having greater expertise or more powerful member states (Pratt 2018a). Individual institutions may also seek to specialize in functions or tasks that complement rather than compete with others."

-  "Bottom-up adaptation is not limited to ceding regulatory space but may also involve deliberate incursion into other institutions' domains in order to capture a share of their resources (Skelcher and Sullivan 2008:758). Betts (2013) explores how growing competition from parallel institutions has led the UNHCR to expand its activities into areas in which it faces strong competition in an effort to recapture resources and preempt regime-shifting by states (see also Lesage and van de Graaf 2013). While the immediate effect of such task-expansion may be to increase regulatory conflict, insofar as other institutional agents choose to yield, the long-term result may be growing taskdifferentiation whereby individual institutions offer distinct but complementary solutions and depend on others to fill regulatory gaps (Abbott 2012)."

4 Conclusions

\par
-  "I have also identified conditions that facilitate "ordering" of governance complexes, including congruent state preferences and an abundance of institutional resources (such as demand for regulation, availability of private and public funding and expert staff) that enable bottom-up adaptation. While there is nothing inevitable or lawlike about the processes of top-down and bottom-up ordering I have identified, my analysis shows that institutional proliferation is not a unidirectional process leading to ever-increasing fragmentation and disorder, but that the opposite process can also be expected and be frequently observed: fragmented and disordered governance systems growing increasingly ordered over time."

International Relations literature offers rich explanations for the creation, design and effectiveness of international institutions and their organisational embodiments, international organizations (IOs), but surprisingly little effort has gone into studying the dynamics of IO termination. Yet if we want to understand the conditions under which international organisations endure, we must also explain why they frequently fail to do so. The article formulates and tests a theory of `IO death' using a combination of population-wide statistical analysis and detailed historical case studies. My analysis is based on an original dataset covering the period 1815\textendash 2016. I find that exogenous shocks are a leading proximate cause of IO terminations since 1815 and that organisations that are newly created, have small memberships, and/or lack centralised structures are most likely to succumb. My analysis leads me to suggest a number of extensions and refinements to existing institutionalist theories.},

  abstract = {The article examines the consequences of functional overlap among regulatory international institutions for governance within institutional complexes. Whereas the existing literature assumes that states tend to exploit forum-shopping opportunities to pursue their parochial interests, we show that multiple members of several overlapping institutions operate in a setting of `nested games'. They have a general interest in some form of institutional complementarity within the complex and therefore take the implications for overlapping institutions into account when determining their behavior within either of these institutions. On that basis, we show first that the multiple members are likely to induce complementary processes of institutional adaptation, even if their interests diverge with regard to the specific form of institutional rearrangement; second, that a balanced distribution of power among the advocates of different institutions may be expected to produce particularly sophisticated forms of institutional adaptation that do not simply separate the domains of overlapping institutions, but establish patterns of permanent co-governance; and third that state-induced processes of institutional adaptation gradually produce a spontaneously emerging division of labor among overlapping institutions that organizes their governance activities. These theoretical claims are probed by two case studies on institutional complexes that are characterized by sharp distributional conflicts among the multiple members: First, we demonstrate the emergence of a sophisticated division of labor in the institutional complex on international trade in agricultural GMOs. Second, we show that an equally sophisticated division of labor has emerged in the institutional complex on public health-related intellectual property rights.},

In this article, I investigate when and why governments choose to interact with and use private rules about carbon offsets in public regulatory arrangements. The analysis demonstrates that there is ``blurring'' between public and private authority, insofar that there are a multiple interactions between the two spheres. However, a closer look reveals that most of these are of a relatively weak nature, since private standards are used for voluntary rather than compliance purposes. To explain this trend, I use qualitative and quantitative analysis and find that NGOs are the main catalysts for the interaction between public and private rules. States are most likely to interact with private regulations when they have large numbers of NGOs active within their borders. In short, private authority is largely a complement to public regulatory arrangements. While previous work that suggests that private authority arises when there are gaps in public rules, the analysis here demonstrates that at the domestic level, this logic does not hold.},

``Instead of creating centralized organizations, states sometimes choose to create complex regimes of smaller organizations, result- ing in possible incoherence and overlap between governing institutions (Biermann et al. 2009; Keohane and Victor 2011). The multiplicity of international adjudicatory bodies may result in the inconsistent application and creation of legal rules (Raustiala 2013). A highly fragmented interna- tional system may be dividing itself into internally coopera- tive groups of states (Rosenau 1995). Of particular rele- vance to this paper, Beckfield (2008, 2010) argues that the international system is fragmented in the sense that the IGO network has become increasingly decentralized.'' (Greenhill and Lupu, 2017, p. 1) Summary of regime complex
\par
``those who study the fragmentation of interna- tional cooperation more broadly (including IGOs, treaties, and other institutions) have long debated its ef- fects, with some arguing that it reduces opportunities for issue linkage (Haas 1980), fosters cooperation by allowing states to reach agreements more easily (Bodansky 2002; Victor 2007), ``jeopardizes the credibility, reliability, and, consequently, the authority of international law'' (Hafner 2003, 856), and unevenly benefits powerful states (Benvenisti and Downs 2009).'' (Greenhill and Lupu, 2017, p. 2) Impact of fragmentation
\par
``fragmentation has actually decreased in recent decades. Rather than suggesting a world in which the states of the Global South are increasingly left behind by increases in institutional cooperation in the North, our re- sults imply that the extent to which cooperation through formal institutions is fragmented has not increased since World War II. This finding suggests that the fragmenta- tion of international cooperation may not be as ubiqui- tous as scholars often assume it to be.'' (Greenhill and Lupu, 2017, p. 2) Findings

This paper seeks to remedy this shortcoming by examining privately created standards within the regime complex for climate change and their relationship to public authority. Public rules in the Kyoto Protocol serve as a ``coral reef,'' attracting private rulemakers whose governance activities come to form part of the regime complex. Using original data, I conduct a network analysis of public and private standards for carbon management. Surprisingly, I find evidence of policy convergence\textemdash both around public rules and a subset of privately created rules: there is an emerging order in the complex institutional landscape that governs climate change. The observed convergence arises from private standards' concerns about demonstrating credibility and providing benefits for users. These findings are important for scholars of institutional complexity and climate politics: public rules on carbon accounting have the potential to outlast their current incarnation in the Kyoto Protocol, as perpetuated through private authority.},

It begins from a set of hypotheses derived from the principal-agent (PA) literature, a natural starting point for answering this question. It then considers explanations based on norms and institutional diffusion to offer a more complete explanation of developments. The study argues that the empowerment of democratic norms and institutional diffusion processes across IGOs have altered member-states' preferences and allowed them to overcome collective action problems involved in the adoption of oversight mechanisms. The hypotheses are tested across more than 70 organizations. The results suggest that arguments extracted from the PA literature and the one on norms allow us to understand which IGOs are more likely to have bureaucratic oversight mechanisms. On the other hand, models that also take into account diffusion processes allow us to understand better when such mechanisms are adopted.},

However, this literature has paid only limited attention to questions of measurement, which is a prerequisite for a more comprehensive understanding of global governance complexity across space and time. In taking a first step in this direction, we make two contributions in the article. First, we propose new quantitative measures that gauge the extent of complexity in global governance, which we conceptualize as the degree to which global governance institutions overlap. Dyadic, weighted, directed-dyadic, and monadic measures enable a multifaceted understanding of this important development in world politics. Second, we illustrate these measures by applying them to an updated version of the most comprehensive data set on the design of intergovernmental organizations (IGOs): the Measure of International Authority (MIA). This allows us to identify cross-sectional and temporal patterns in the extent to which important IGOs, which tend to form the core of sprawling regime complexes in many issue areas, overlap. We conclude by outlining notable implications for, and potential applications of, our measures for research on institutional design and evolution, legitimacy, and legitimation, as well as effectiveness and performance. This discussion underscores the utility of the proposed measures, as both dependent and independent variables, to researchers examining the sources and consequences of institutional overlap in global governance and beyond.},

``International relations research is increasingly addressing questions relating to the complexity of global governance, which has grown enormously since the end of the Second World War and has diversified in institutional form. Whereas the post-War international order was centrally based on a few well-ordered intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) and treaties \textendash{} the United Nations (UN), the International Mone- tary Fund, the World Bank (WB), and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) \textendash{} today's global governance architecture consists of a variety of formal and informal, regional, and global IGOs, self-standing international treaties, trans- governmental networks, non-governmental organizations, and transnational public\textendash{} private partnerships. This multiplication and diversification of international institutions has resulted in a much denser global governance space.''

\par
``Systematic explorations of institutional complexity in global governance require a comprehensive picture of the phenomenon under study. How extensive is it? How does it vary across organizations, issue areas, and parts of the world? How has it evolved over time? Surprisingly, scholars have focused most of their attention on conceptual- izing the phenomenon and discussing its sources and consequences, drawing on a small number of cases, rather than on gauging the extent of the phenomenon itself. Hence, our empirical knowledge of the institutional complexity of global governance remains limited.'' (Haftel and Lenz, 2021, p. 2) Lack of systemic mapping of copmlexity

``Some scholars have started mapping the institutional complexes in individual issue areas, such as plant genetic resources (Raustiala and Victor 2004), climate change (Abbott 2012; Keohane and Victor 2011), trade (Brosig 2011; Davis 2009; G\'omez-'' (Haftel and Lenz, 2021, p. 2) Examples of regime complexes analysed qualitatively

However, these analyses tend to be rich qualitative descriptions that do not rest on a generic measure suitable for applications across issue areas and geographical regions, and also commonly provide snapshot pictures that neglect the evolution of complexity over time.

\par
``following Eilstrup-Sangiovanni and Westerwinter's (2020) call, we propose new, quantitative measures of institutional complexity in global governance, which we conceptualize as overlap between global governance institutions. The first, `baseline' measure gauges the overlap between institutional pairs, calculated on the basis of their overlap in membership and the policy areas in which they have competency. The second measure begins with the baseline measure but takes into account the centrality of an institution's policy competencies to its activity. A third, directed-dyadic measure affords insights into potential imbalances in overlap between two institutions that are unequal in terms of membership and policy competency. Finally, we use this directed-dyadic measure to calculate a monadic measure that allows us to gauge the degree of overlap of a specific institution with two or more additional institutions. This variable serves as a proxy for the interaction potential between an individual institution within, for example, an issue- specific governance complex or a geographically demarcated complex. These different measures are applicable to a broad set of governance institutions and can be used by scholars studying these phenomena.2 They allow scholars to systematically capture the potential for the aforementioned problems of global governance complexity to emerge, and to study the sources and consequences of this empirical phenomenon.'' (Haftel and Lenz, 2021, p. 3) Measure of institutional complexity
\par
``We find that IGO overlap, in general, has roughly doubled from 1970 until today, and that this process was driven mostly by the expansion of IGOs' policy competencies rather than by membership. Drawing on the distinction between general purpose and task specific IGOs (Lenz et al. 2015), we also show that the degree of overlap between task specific IGOs tends to be bimodal (that is, either high or low'' (Haftel and Lenz, 2021, p. 3) Findings
\par
``The notion of institutional overlap is central to any understanding of governance complex- ity. In their agenda-setting piece, Raustiala and Victor (2004: 279) defined what they term a regime complex as a ``an array of partially overlapping and nonhierarchical institutions governing a particular issue area.'' In another influential contribution, Orsini et al. (2013: 29) defined a regime complex as ``a network of three or more international regimes that relate to a common subject matter; exhibit overlapping membership; and generate substan- tive, normative, or operative interactions recognized as potentially problematic whether or not they are managed effectively.'' A recent overview uses the following definition: ``A regime complex is an array of partially overlapping and non-hierarchical institutions that includes more than one international agreement or authority'' (Alter and Raustiala 2018: 332). Eilstrup-Sangiovanni and Westerwinter (2020) used the notion of global governance complex, which they define as ``a system of governance composed of at least three international or transnational institutions or actors whose missions, functions, and mem- bership overlap, and that jointly address a specific policy problem.'''' (Haftel and Lenz, 2021, p. 5) Definitions of regime complex
\par
``This implies that there are two elements of institutional overlap, both of which are necessary and jointly sufficient: overlap in policy competency and overlap in member- ship. The former means that two institutions govern the same policy area, whether it is the liberalization of trade, the maintenance of international peace and security, or environmental protection. For example, the WTO and the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) overlap in policy competency (trade liberalization), as do the UN and the AU (international peace and security). Overlapping membership denotes a situation in which the same states (or other actors) are members in two or more institutions. For example, the Council of Europe (CoE) and the European Union (EU) share large parts of their membership, as do the OAS and the Andean Community (ANCOM).'' (Haftel and Lenz, 2021, p. 5) Type of overlap among institutions
\par
``institutional overlap may result from three distinct processes: the creation of a new institution with similar policy competencies to an existing one, accession of new members to an existing institution, and policy expansion of an existing institution'' (Haftel and Lenz, 2021, p. 6) Origins of institutional overlps
\par
``institutional overlap may result from an expansion of an institution's policy competency such that it starts encroaching on that of another institution (Betts 2013). As new transnational problems arise, states regularly expand the policy competency of an existing institution to address them, rather than creating a new one (Jupille et al. 2013). Alternatively, like-minded states in a gridlocked institution may employ a different institution in which they are members in order to tackle a broader set of policies (Haftel and Hofmann 2019). An example of such a process is the expansion of the EU into the security realm with the Common Security and Defence Policy in 1993, which made it overlap with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) (Hofmann 2019).'' (Haftel and Lenz, 2021, p. 6) Overlap from institutional expansion
\par
``Two other components of our measure require operationalization. Regarding membership, we follow conventional operationalizations that gauge the number of states that are full members in a specific IGO. We use the Correlates of War IGO Version 3.0 dataset for data on IGO membership (Pevehouse et al. 2020). This dataset includes membership information up to 2014, thereby bounding the em- pirical analysis to that year. To operationalize policy competency, we rely on Hooghe et al. (2019), who identified twenty-five policy areas listed in Appendix B, and determined whether a given IGO has competency in each of them in a given year, based on eight legal, financial, and organizational indicators. We also follow Hooghe et al.'s distinction between `core' competencies, which require the presence of at least three such indicators, and `flanking' ones, which indicate the presence of only one or two indicators.

\par
``analyses expect overlap to undermine performance due to conflicting rules and norms (Alter and Meunier 2009; Raustiala and Victor 2004), others expect overlap to have little effect on performance, or even to enhance it, due to processes of inter-institutional coordination (Eilstrup-Sangiovanni 2021; Gehring and Faude 2014; Pratt 2018).

In particular, many regional economic organizations (REOs) have expanded into the security realm. This trend has often resulted in an overlap with regional security organizations (RSOs) already in place. This study sheds light on this phenomenon by identifying the conditions under which REOs trespass into the security policy domain despite the fact that preexisting RSOs already fulfill security functions. We argue that the presence of strategic rivalries is an important driver of the creation and depth of organizational overlap through scope expansion. Specifically, RSOs that include significant interstate rivalries propel a subgroup of like-minded states to advance and deepen security cooperation through their existing REOs. Using an original data set of security cooperation within economic and security ROs and a quantitative analysis, we find substantial support for this argument.},

have expanded their scope beyond pure economic matters and include a variety of \\
nontrade issues (NTIs). Thus, many trade agreements tackle NTIs such as human \\
rights, labor, and the environment (Milewicz et al. 2018). This expansion may be \\
driven, at least in part, by rivalries in multilateral bodies that were supposed to \\
address such issues. It seems plausible that the deadlock in the World Trade Orga- \\
nization and the UN, not least because of persistent rivalries among some of their \\
leading members, drove smaller groups of like-minded states to adopt NTIs in their \\
regional IOs or bilateral agreements. That being said, such extensions require some \\
caution. Cooperation on international security is different from most other NTIs, \\

regression techniques to test the effect of existing RSO performance and the severity \\
of RSO internal rivalry on the extent of security cooperation within REOs. This \\

``Finally, the logic of our argument may ``travel'' beyond the security policy \\
domain. As recent research demonstrates, REOs and other economic agreements \\
have expanded their scope beyond pure economic matters and include a variety of \\
nontrade issues (NTIs). Thus, many trade agreements tackle NTIs such as human \\
rights, labor, and the environment (Milewicz et al. 2018). This expansion may be \\
driven, at least in part, by rivalries in multilateral bodies that were supposed to \\
address such issues. It seems plausible that the deadlock in the World Trade Orga- \\
nization and the UN, not least because of persistent rivalries among some of their \\
leading members, drove smaller groups of like-minded states to adopt NTIs in their \\
regional IOs or bilateral agreements. That being said, such extensions require some \\
caution. Cooperation on international security is different from most other NTIs, \\
which deal mostly with domestic regulation'' \\

-  "A central question for this research program is whether regime complexes improve or degrade substantive outcomes compared to a single multilateral institution.  Many scholars argue that the fragmentation of governance across multiple institutions poses a threat to the effectiveness of international cooperation.  These analysts fear that ambiguity over international standards, inconsistency of rules and obligations, and opportunities for forum shopping weaken the discipline of global governance on member states.1  Others contend that regime complexes facilitate more effective cooperation: they increase flexibility, boost legitimacy, and engender greater expertise compared to unified regimes.2  Despite this rich variation in regime-complex performance, few studies have explicitly questioned why some regime complexes produce more favorable outcomes than others.3" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L3EY287Q?page=3}{Henning and Pratt 2021:40})

-  "In subsequent work, scholars challenged the view that inter-institutional relations in regime complexes are necessarily characterized by disorder.  Overlapping institutions have developed a wide range of ties to coordinate rules, from simple communication to joint decisionmaking.4  Studies focusing on "inter-organizational networking," "institutional deference," and "orchestration" document these ties in several regime complexes.5 In addition to formal coordinating mechanisms, the mere presence of a prominent, central institution may allow rules to cohere in advantageous ways.6  In some cases, a sophisticated division of labor can emerge among governing bodies, reducing inconsistency and opportunities to forum shop. 7 As in other complex adaptive systems, overlapping institutions may develop a degree of order without any centralized means of coordination" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L3EY287Q?page=4}{Henning and Pratt 2021:41})

-  "We argue that the initial characterization of fragmentated regime complexes, featuring decentralized decision making, lack of hierarchy, and policy incoherence, is only one of several ways in which a regime complex might be organized.  We instead dissect the concept along two dimensions - relations of authority and institutional differentiation - along which sets of overlapping institutions vary.  A fragmented regime complex is an ideal type that sits at one end of both dimensions, where institutions are nonhierarchically arranged and undifferentiated.  An integrated complex sits at the other end of the spectrum, where governance processes are hierarchical and differentiated.  Empirically, regime complexes will take intermediate values on one or both dimensions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L3EY287Q?page=4}{Henning and Pratt 2021:41})

\par
-  "In this paper, we define a regime complex as a set of international institutions that operate in a common issue area and the (formal and informal) mechanisms that coordinate them. The institutions can be legally constituted organizations at the bilateral, plurilateral, regional, or global levels, as well as less formal arrangements.  Mechanisms of coordination include both deliberate inter-institutional collaboration and recurring patterns of behavior that emerge from repeated interaction in a dense institutional environment.  Our framework emphasizes two such mechanisms, authority relations and institutional differentiation, though these do not exhaust the possible means by which institutions can be coordinated. 10 This definition is both broader and narrower than some other formulations in the field. It is broader in that a regime complex is not non-hierarchical by definition" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L3EY287Q?page=6}{Henning and Pratt 2021:43})

-  "We adopt a broad concept of what constitutes an international institution.  The concept is not restricted to highly structured intergovernmental organizations (IGOs).  It includes fora such as the Group of Twenty (G20) or Group of Seven (G7) that are not based on formal treaties; organizations constituted by substate regulators (transgovernmental regulatory networks); civil society and nongovernmental organizations; private associations and private transnational regulatory organizations (PTROs); and multi-stakeholder institutions, which are constituted by governmental, private and NGO representatives.  Each of these institutions seeks to govern international cooperation, and each may be part of a regime complex" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L3EY287Q?page=7}{Henning and Pratt 2021:44})

-  "Like others, we identify the boundaries of a regime complex by the scope of the issue area to which it is addressed.  We define an issue area as a set of problems for international cooperation that are connected by significant substantive spillover.  These boundaries are not always fixed, as issue areas may shift due to exogenous events or purposive state action.  Its edges can be sharp or fuzzy, but in either case the issue area is defined by a density of connection among substantive problems.  In this conception, global governance is cleaved into a series of regime complexes within which spillovers are denser than they are across separate issue areas. The institutions of balance-of-payments finance and development finance inhabit different complexes, for example.  There is some spillover between the work of the World Bank and IMF, but the density of connection among the multilateral development banks is considerably greater than between them and the Fund."

-  "Finally, an institution that provides governance functions in different issue areas can thus sit in two or more regime complexes simultaneously.  We regard such dual membership to be unproblematic for the purpose of comparing the origins and consequences of complexes.  For example, the development finance complex could feature hierarchical authority relations while the climate-change complex does not, notwithstanding the fact that the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development participates in both regime complexes."

-  "institutions are bound by the superior authority of others.  Within hierarchical authority relations, for example, one institution could be "nested" within and legally subordinate to another.16  In between these poles lies a diverse set of arrangements in which institutions distribute authority by delegating, orchestrating, and deferring to each other.  Inter-institutional patterns of authority have important implications for the degree of rule conflict and opportunities for forum shopping in a regime complex."

Entrepreneurial authority occurs when one actor creates rules and then persuades others to defer to them.  While we see evidence of both types, many emergent authority patterns in regime complexes are consistent with the exercise of entrepreneurial authority" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L3EY287Q?page=10}{Henning and Pratt 2021:47})

-  "Once established, hierarchical authority relations may persist, strengthen, or unravel.  As Morse and Keohane (2014) and Hofmann (2019) highlight, states often use multilateral institutions to contest existing patterns of governance authority.  For example, in the 1990s developed countries successfully shifted negotiations over rules for intellectual property protection to the GATT/WTO, challenging the supremacy of the World Intellectual Property Organization.  Such instances of "regime shifting" will tend to flatten the hierarchy of a regime complex.   The construction, maintenance, and deconstruction of authority relations are usefully viewed as linked dynamic processes driven by the strategic interests of member states and other actors."

-  "The second dimension that we examine is differentiation of institutions.  Differentiation describes the extent to which institutions in a regime complex vary in the functions they perform. Like relations of authority, differentiation can be placed on a continuum.  Sets of identical institutions that operate as like units are positioned at one end; these homogeneous institutions perform the same functions and are viewed as substitutes by states.  At the other end are sets of institutions that are fully differentiated in the tasks they perform and the rules they adopt. Regime complexes can be differentiated functionally and geographically."

In contrast, states have less freedom to forum shop if institutions are highly differentiated." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L3EY287Q?page=12}{Henning and Pratt 2021:49})

-  "Hierarchical-differentiated.  Regime complexes that are characterized by strong hierarchy among differentiated institutions (the Northeast corner) offer little room for forum shopping or otherwise playing institutions off against one another.  Rules are likely to be clear and coherent, and we expect policy compliance and adjustment to be comparatively strong.  The peak institution will encourage harmony of purpose, while high levels of differentiation mean that institutional programs and activities may be specialized rather than collaborative.  Because institutional specialization makes it difficult for dissatisfied states to engage in regime shifting, while hierarchy creates obstacles to competitive regime creation, the bar for changing the architecture is high; dissatisfaction must be larger and more sustained relative to other corners to overcome these obstacles. The regime for international financial regulation provides a useful illustration of a hierarchical-differentiated complex.  Global governance takes place in a cluster of more than twenty standard-setting bodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, International Organization of Securities Commissions, and International Accounting Standards Board.35   Some institutions enjoy more authority than others.  Many of the standard-setting bodies (SSBs) meet under the aegis of the Bank for International Settlements.  The leading role of the Basel Committee was bolstered by endorsements from the G7 after the Asian financial crisis and the global financial crisis.  In 2009, the Group of Twenty (G20) built the Financial Stability Board (FSB) upon a prior forum and gave it the mandate to referee overlapping jurisdictions of the SSBs. Walter (2019) describes the FSB as the "peak body."  Financial regulatory institutions also exhibit significant differentiation, consistent with a functional division of labor.  Separate bodies address securities regulation, accounting standards, and assessment of banking risk.  Institutions have developed specialized expertise to regulate" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L3EY287Q?page=19}{Henning and Pratt 2021:56})

Consistent with our expectations for complexes in this space, we observe a low degree of competition among standard-setting bodies in finance, relatively little forum shopping, and pressure for compliance. Whether the United States and the European Union ultimately follow Basel standards is an open question, but they have so far respected the spirit of these regulations, albeit sometimes through alternative practices and supervision.  Despite discontent with their influence in these bodies, emerging-market countries have not promoted alternative forums.36 Regime shifting and regime creation are rare to nonexistent" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L3EY287Q?page=20}{Henning and Pratt 2021:57})

-  "Drawing on theories of institutions, we employ the basic distinction between exogenous and endogenous change of regime complexes.51  By exogenous change, we refer to independent shifts in the original, underlying sources of regime complex architecture identified in Figure 1. These variables - transformations in state preferences and power relations, for example - are commonly shaped by forces external to the operation of the regime complex.  As they evolve, we expect corresponding changes in hierarchy and differentiation among institutions in the complex, albeit with possible lags or distortions.  We refer to change that originates from the operation of complexes over time, by contrast, as endogenous.  In our framework, endogenous change emerges due to feedback loops between the substantive outcomes and regime complex architecture, and it is the theoretically more challenging of the two sources of evolution.52" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L3EY287Q?page=24}{Henning and Pratt 2021:61})

-  "Endogenous change often depends on the manner in which institutions respond to jurisdictional overlap.  Contributors to this volume highlight competition and collaboration as key institutional responses.  Kijima and Lipscy (2021) stress competition, which depends in part on issue-area structure, while Henning (2021) and Westerwinter (2021) emphasize collaboration. Both strategies are responses to the potential for conflict to which overlap gives rise - although they can be promoted by principals directly as well -- and have consequences for the subsequent evolution of the architecture.  Competition is likely to produce winners and losers, contributing to hierarchy, or, if institutions avoid it, niche finding.  By contrast, collaboration is likely to perpetuate overlaps and less hierarchical authority relations." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L3EY287Q?page=25}{Henning and Pratt 2021:62})

  abstract = {This book addresses the institutions that were deployed to fight the euro crisis, re-establish financial stability, and prevent contagion beyond Europe. It addresses why European leaders chose to include the International Monetary Fund and provides a detailed account of the decisions of the institutions that make up the ``troika'' (the European Commission, European Central Bank, and IMF). The study explains the institutions' negotiating strategies, the outcomes of their interaction, and the effectiveness of their cooperation. It also explores the strategies of the member states, including Germany and the United States, with respect to the institutions and the advantages they sought in directing them to work together. The book locates the analysis within the framework of regime complexity, clusters of overlapping and intersecting regional and multilateral institutions. It tests conjectures spawned by that literature against the seven cases of financial rescues of euro-area countries that were stricken by crisis during 2010\textendash 15. The book concludes that regime complexity is the consequence of a strategy by key states to control ``agency drift.'' States mediate conflicts among institutions, through informal as well as formal mechanisms, and thereby limit fragmentation of the regime complex and underpin substantive efficacy. In so doing, the book answers several key puzzles, including why (a) Germany and other northern European countries supported IMF inclusion despite substantive positions opposed to their economic preferences, (b) crisis-fighting arrangements endured intense conflicts among the institutions, and (c) the United States and the IMF promoted further steps to ``complete'' the monetary union.},

We theorize that delegation and pooling are empirically as well as conceptually different. Delegation is an effort to deal with the transaction costs of cooperation which are greater in larger, broader, and correspondingly more complex organizations. Pooling reflects the tension between protecting or surrendering the national veto. This paper theorizes that delegation and pooling are constrained by two basic design features: a) the scope of an IO's policy portfolio and b) the scale of its membership. We test these hypotheses with a new cross-sectional dataset that provides detailed and reliable information on IO decision making. Our major finding is that the design of international organizations is framed by stark and intelligible choices, but in surprising ways. Large membership organizations tend to have both more delegation and more pooling. The broader the policy scope of an IO, the more willing are its members to delegate, but the less willing they are to pool authority.},

  abstract = {Abstract             International institutions such as treaties and organizations shape, and are shaped by, the large web-like architecture of global governance. Yet we know little about what this architecture looks like, why certain structures are observed, and how they are linked to the functioning of international institutions as well as the overall effectiveness of global governance. Over the past decade, network science has emerged as a promising and indispensable approach to unraveling structural nuances and complexities of the system of international institutions. This article presents a state-of-the-art review of this emerging field of research and seeks to stimulate its further development. In this article, I draw connections between various network analyses of global governance that are found in different bodies of literature. In so doing, I integrate three separate but overlapping strands of work on institutional fragmentation, polycentricity, and complexity and bring much-needed conceptual clarity to the debate. Building on previous studies, I propose a framework for operationalizing fragmentation, polycentricity, and complexity in network terms in order to enable systematic and comparative analysis of global governance systems. This article argues that there is much potential in the network approach and makes a case for advancing the ``network science of global governance.''},

"scholars have imported three concepts from different disciplines and applied them to global governance research. They are fragmentation (Biermann et al. 2009), polycentricity (Jordan et al. 2018), and complexity (Orsini et al. 2019). Each of these concepts comes with its own assumptions and biases. For example, fragmentation focuses on patterns of cooperation versus competition or connectivity versus disconnectivity. Polycentricity is contrasted against monocentricity, and it refers to a situation where many elements mutually adjust and order relationships with one another in the absence of a central authority. Complexity requires emergence and self-organization among parts, distinguishing complex systems from systems that are just complicated by possessing many parts."

"Many scholars characterize the architecture of global governance as fragmented (e.g., Biermann et al. 2009; Zelli 2011; van Asselt 2014). Originating from international law scholarship, the concept of fragmentation is understood in global governance as "the extent to which the world consists of distinct clusters of [intergovernmental organization]-based cooperation" (Greenhill and Lupu 2017, 193)."

"Depending on the analytical focus, this network can be converted into a network consisting of only one type of node, either (1) a network of actors, in which institutions serve as links through which actors interact, or (2) a network of institutions, where institutions are nodes that are coupled in some way. Examples of the first type include network models of states or cities that are institutionally tied together through bilateral (e.g., Goyal and Joshi 2006; Saban, Bonomo, and Stier-Moses 2010; Oatley et al. 2013; Cranmer, Heinrich, and Desmarais 2014) or multilateral agreements (e.g., Maoz 2011; Kinne 2013b; Milewicz et al. 2017; Sopranzetti 2018; Lee 2019). The second type is exemplified by studies on international agreements and organizations that are linked through references or overlap in membership (e.g., Kim 2013; Greenhill and Lupu 2017; Perez, Cohen, and Schreiber 2018). This article is particularly concerned with this second type\textemdash networks of international institutions\textemdash which is also referred to as "global governance networks" (Eilstrup-Sangiovanni 2017)."

"But the proliferation of these international institutions has raised new concerns about institutional fragmentation or complexity (Beckfield 2008). Attention is increasingly paid to structural properties of these "clubs of clubs" that are divided along sectoral or regional lines (Greenhill and Lupu 2017). In other words, just like states had to be brought together with the help of international institutions, the myriad international institutions themselves are in need of coordination for their effectiveness. This is an ultimate policy objective of the emerging field of research on global governance networks" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4DFW8RA8?page=7}{Kim 2020:909})

"So far, three types of links have been used for modeling networks of international institutions. First, shared membership across international institutions has been a common proxy for interinstitutional relationships. Scholars have employed it in studies on, for example, networks of intergovernmental organizations (Beckfield 2010; Gomez and Parigi 2015; Greenhill and Lupu 2017), multilateral agreements (B\"ohmelt and Spilker 2016; Hollway and Koskinen 2016), and public international and transnational institutions (Widerberg 2016; Perez et al. 2018)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4DFW8RA8?page=8}{Kim 2020:910})

"the general trend over a long span of time has been, contrary to the general wisdom, governance defragmentation. In other words, the continuing proliferation of international institutions has resulted not in fragmentation but rather in a surprisingly cohesive structure with multiple centers of decision-making that are, to varying extents, interconnected. For example, the studies of multilateral environmental agreements (Kim 2013) and intergovernmental organizations (Greenhill and Lupu 2017) show that both of these networks have become less fragmented over the past decades. Overall, global institutional networks are not simply fracturing but also contracting or defragmenting" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4DFW8RA8?page=11}{Kim 2020:913})

(\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4DFW8RA8?page=12}{Kim 2020:914})
\par
"Second, the network approach has revealed some degree of order or hierarchy in the underlying structure of various global governance systems. In the system of multilateral environmental agreements, for example, order was identified to have emerged around 1992 as a result of structural transformation into a small world through a set of new critical "short cuts" between a few key agreements (Kim 2013). Similarly, Green (2013) also observed that a district order emerged out of the seemingly chaotic and complex institutional landscape of global carbon standards. The observation of emergent hierarchy across many global governance systems is contrary to the conventional wisdom that institutional complexes of nested, partially overlapping, and parallel international regimes are nonhierarchically ordered (Alter and Meunier 2009)."

"rules, norms, and principles of the institutions in most central positions have a higher chance of diffusing across the network and have system-wide effects. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which is the most central institution in the system of multilateral environmental agreements, is a case in point (Kim 2013). These central institutions that are rich in connections attract even more connections from other international institutions. Global governance networks serve as a public good for institutions embedded therein, and this perspective points to the possibility of improving and exploiting this social capital (Ingold 2017; Young 2017)."

"Many studies presented in table 2 have put forward different but comparable ways to operationalize institutional fragmentation. For example, Kim (2013) used a relatively simple way of measuring the degree of fragmentation through the fraction of the largest component of a network. Orsini et al. (2013) operationalized fragmentation in terms of low network density and centralization. Pattberg et al. (2014) similarly used average degree and centralization as key variables. Beckfield (2010) proposed a combination of low density and relatively high average path length in comparison to network diameter. Yet other studies conceptualized fragmentation primarily in terms of modularity. For example, Greenhill and Lupu (2017) used a combination of metrics including modularity, and Gomez and Parigi (2015) used a special class of modularity measure called hierarchical link clustering to measure the degree of fragmentation."

"cooperation (Perez et al. 2018), and web-based data such as hyperlinks (McNutt and Pal 2011; Yi and Scholz 2016) and Twitter tweets (Kolleck et al. 2017) have been proven useful. Other suggestions include mapping how problems shift (Kim and van Asselt 2016), how policies diffuse (Sommerer and Tallberg 2019), or how resources flow between international institutions. Some argue that we need to move beyond abstract institutional ties and start using more concrete interpersonal ties between decision-makers in global governance (Paterson 2019)."

"No doubt data availability is a key bottleneck in this field. There is not enough quality longitudinal, relational data available to significantly advance a network understanding of global institutional complexity. Shared membership data\textemdash which is available through a number of datasets including the Correlates of War Project (Pevehouse, Nordstrom, and Warnke 2004)\textemdash is probably the only exception. Other datasets on international institutions have been developed and maintained, such as ECOLEX (FAO, IUCN, and UNEP 2019), the International Environmental Agreements Database (Mitchell 2003), the Trade and Environment Database (Morin, D\"ur, and Lechner 2018), the Design of Trade Agreements Database (D\"ur, Baccini, and Elsig 2014), and the Yearbook of International Organizations (UIA 2018). However, some of these datasets are not open access and, more importantly, relational data is not always collected or complete. ECOLEX, for example, only lists references between treaties that are legally related, while the Yearbook of International Organizations contains self-reported information on interorganizational relationships, but the data can be expensive for personal research use.

  abstract = {Included from 1992 in the International Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), themes related to Health are increasingly cited in later COPs (Conferences of the Parties) as well as taken into account into other conventions (CMS, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species or CITES, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species). From a biodiversity perspective, Health thematic encompasses dimensions of human health, animal health (domestic and wild fauna), and ecosystem health. Other ecological or environmental concepts such as biodiversity, ecosystemic approach, and risks assessment favored the emergence of Health issues and their integration into the CBD.Having realized the mining of the textual corpus associating the three conventions related to biodiversity and all the decisions or resolutions of their respective COPs up to 2014, we obtain more than 22,172 complex nominal terms among which 213 are related to Health. Those terms are organized hierarchically into concepts (micro-ontologies), specific to each concept linked to Health (biodiversity, disease, health, pathogen, security, warning, etc.). We thus analyze how concepts are used in a complete or partial form in each COP and how they are transmitted between COPs through a multiplex network: each type of link of the network corresponds to a concept. Then, we identify the most central COPs and their gathering into communities in the process of Health issues emergence. The terminological network links being colored by concepts, we analyze how each concept contributes to the building of an integrative and multi-dimensional approach of Health issues within the main biodiversity-related conventions.},

  abstract = {Why and how do international courts justify decisions with citations to their own case law? We argue that, like domestic review courts, international courts use precedent at least in part to convince `lower' (domestic) courts of the legitimacy of judgements. Several empirical observations are consistent with this view, which are examined through a network analysis of European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) citations. First, the Court cites precedent based on the legal issues in the case, not the country of origin. Second, the Court is more careful to embed judgements in its existing case law when the expected value of persuading domestic judges is highest. These findings contribute to a developing literature that suggests international and domestic review courts develop their authority in similar ways.},
  langid = {english},
  keywords = {\#todo/process,citation analysis,courts,regime complex},
  note = {- ``Following recent analyses of citation patterns by the US Supreme Court (USSC), we apply network analysis to study the use of precedent.1 We have three core findings. First, the ECtHR embeds its judgements more strongly with citations to precedent in those cases where domestic courts can expect the most resistance from the executive branch (and thus need more persuading). Second, ECtHR judgements are more embedded in precedent when the Court decides cases from common law countries where domestic courts rely more strongly on precedent and thus the potential persuasive value of case law citation is highest. Thirdly, broad patterns of citations to precedent, including communities of case-law, are significantly determined by case-specific characteristics rather than by legal culture or other country-specific factors.'' (Lupu and Voeten, 2012, p. 2) ~Findings about when international courts cite other courts
\par
- ``We have data on all 7,319 cases the Court decided up to and including 2006. These judgements include 35,963 citations to previous Court decisions.52 Like the citation networks studied by other scholars,53 the Court's citation network has one main cluster and a large number of isolated cases, almost all of which neither cite precedent nor are cited by other cases.54 Following the work of prior citation studies, we exclude these isolated cases'' (Lupu and Voeten, 2012, p. 12) ~Citation network data
\par
- ``A useful way of summarizing the properties of a citation network is by examining the distributions of inward citations (i.e., citations to a case) and outward citations (i.e., citations from a case). Other studies have shown that most USSC decisions are cited by relatively few other cases, while a small number of decisions are cited very often.57 Similarly, most USSC decisions cite relatively few other precedents, while a minority of decisions cite many precedents.'' (Lupu and Voeten, 2012, p. 13) ~Inward vs outward citation
\par
- ``The extent to which judges in any court cite precedent is subject to changes over time as the number of relevant precedents grows and behavioural norms change. Studies of the USSC have shown that, while the average USSC decision cited fewer than five of the Court's precedents (outward citations) during the nineteenth century, by the beginning of the twenty-first century that number had grown to over twenty.59 The ECtHR has experienced a similar growth in the number of outward citations, as shown in Figure 3. There is a particular increase in the number of outward citations after 1999, the first year of the post-Protocol XI Court.60'' (Lupu and Voeten, 2012, p. 14) ~Change in number of citation over time
\par
- ``A hub is a judgement that cites many other judgements, helping to define which legally relevant decisions are pertinent to a given precedent. An authority is a judgement that is widely cited by other judgements. Most judgements act as both hubs and authorities, and the degree to which they fulfil these roles is mutually reinforcing within the network of cases. An opinion that is a good hub cites many good authorities, and an opinion that is a good authority is cited by many good hubs. Two factors directly affect the hub score of a case: (1) the number of other cases it cites; and (2) the authority scores of the cases it cites. Thus, while it is possible for a case to have a large hub score by simply citing many unimportant cases, the cases with the largest hub scores are ones that cite many important precedents. Thus, the hub score is a good measure of the extent to which an opinion relies on citations to precedent to justify the Court's decision'' (Lupu and Voeten, 2012, p. 16) ~Hub vs authorities in citation network
\par
- ``Consistent with the network analysis literature, we define a community as a group of cases that cite each other more often than they cite cases outside the community.77 The method we used to detect the community structure of the network is designed to maximize the extent to which cases placed in a given community cite each other and minimize citations between cases in different communities. In network analysis, this is often referred to as the modularity of a network partition, which is an indication of how well it separates the communities from each other.78 Community analysis has been applied in legislative studies of committee membership,79 roll-call voting80 and bill co-sponsorship81 in the US House of Representatives.'' (Lupu and Voeten, 2012, p. 22) ~Community detection network in citation network
\par
- ``Our findings certainly do not imply that citations are not used to enhance internal communication and to improve efficiency. They do, however, imply that these are not the only purposes of citations. Citations also serve the purpose of legitimating decisions to an external audience. This finding is similar to that which studies of citation practices in domestic constitutional courts have found. Even domestic judges in well-established democracies do not operate in splendid isolation. In this sense, our findings are consistent with Voeten's finding that ECtHR judges are political actors in similar ways to domestic review judges: they wish to see the law reflect their policy preferences (as do domestic judges), but they do not necessarily use judgements to settle geopolitical scores or otherwise reflect national interests or culture.8'' (Lupu and Voeten, 2012, p. 26) ~Purpose of citations},

conflicts over global policy influence (Morse and Keohane 2014; Hannah et al. 2017). \\
Betts (2013:76) argues that regime complexes encourage competition among IOs \\
because institutional proliferation provides states with more choices ``in terms of which \\
institutions they could use to address a given problem.'' IO secretariats have been \\
shown to respond to competitive pressures by pursuing boundary maintenance to \\
protect their focality (Holzscheiter 2017; Kranke 2020), forum-shifting to regain ``lost'' \\
focality to other IOs (G\'omez-Mera 2016) and/or working with like-minded states to \\

rather one IO seeking to insert itself into the politics of decision-making at an \\
overlapping organization in order to influence a particular outcome there. In contrast \\
to competition, intervention is not characterized by two secretariats engaging in a zero- \\

An IO's organizational culture refers to ``the shared ideologies, norms, and routines'' \\
that shape the secretariat's expectations about how its mandate is to be operational- \\
ized, its professional identities and values, and what behavior will be rewarded or \\
punished (Nielson et al. 2006:109). Scholarship on organizational culture has shown \\
that IO behavior is guided by both strategic and principled considerations; this \\
manifests itself in how a secretariat understands the causes and solutions to interna- \\
tional policy problems and how it responds to changes in its external environment \\

``The cases analyzed here, however, suggest that powerful \\
IOs are likely to be the target of intervention. A reason for this is that decisions issued \\
by IOs with strong rules and wide-ranging scope have greater potential to have \\
spillover effects elsewhere in a regime complex compared to IOs with narrow mandates \\
and weak rules that do not produce consequential effects on other partially-overlapping \\

intervene, how, and to what effect. First, in order to further specify the conditions that \\
give rise to intervention, future studies will need to expand the sample of cases, both by \\

action, information about the relevant decision, and anticipates the decision to have \\
negative consequences \textendash{} but the IO chooses not to intervene) would further improve \\
our understanding of the internal evaluation process undertaken by secretariats in \\
deciding whether or not to engage in intervention. In addition, in the cases analyzed \\

about the effectiveness of particular intervention strategies. Future research is \\

successful or not. Among other questions, are certain types of IOs more effective \\
than others at intervening? Are certain intervention strategies more successful than \\
others? Such analysis will require comparison of positive and negative cases \textendash{} that \\

Among the findings, the U.S. government is prominent in the first three, while international organizations dominate the others. VPN rankings show that the World Bank dominates the OECD.

Most approaches to power and centrality focus on the direct effects of the possession of resources or ties. By contrast, centrality can also inform how network structures constrain behavior through diffuse power processes. The usefulness of this approach is illustrated by replicating two important papers on socialization through democratic international organizations and producing order through alliance hierarchies. Using network conceptualizations and measurements of these processes allows for better connections between theory and empirics, more precise hypothesis testing, broadened scope, and improved models. Particularly this network analysis shows that socialization by democratic international organizations is more important than dispute resolution mechanisms in preventing conflict and ordering through hierarchical structures occurs throughout the entire international alliance system.},

``the present-day organizational landscape in global financial standard setting continues to be characterized by fragmentation and a functional division of labor. Banking regulation is coordinated through the BCBS; the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) is in charge of rules for securities markets and credit rating agencies. The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) sets accounting standards for most of the world, with the notable exception of the United States, which has its own standard setter. Yet other facets of financial governance, for example the regulation of hedge funds, have been dealt with predominantly by national or European authorities, without a strong role for an international standard setter. The FSB provides some coordination between these organizations without, however, steering or directing their efforts in a meaningful way.'' (M\"ugge and Perry, 2014, p. 195)

``Reflexive finance implies that asset prices are endogenous to the system of rules governing financial markets, as well as to the broader social institutions in which that system is embedded. If this is indeed the case, then managing and controlling the interactions between different regulatory domains becomes a core function of global financial governance. This requires a sharp departure from the fragmented, decentralized cooperation model and the pursuit of significantly tighter coordination between regulatory domains than has hitherto been the case.''

``The fragmentation of banking regulation, accounting standards, and rules for credit rating agencies and derivatives trading represents a crucial obstacle in the way of effective and legitimate policy. As Minsky and others since him have emphasized, we should expect banks to use their room for maneuver to increase profitability by taking on additional risk. A faulty regulatory instrument for linking regulatory capital to balance sheet risks therefore constitutes a major weakness in the global regulatory edifice.'' (M\"ugge and Perry, 2014, p. 197)

``Obviously, we are not the first to criticize the fragmented arrangements of global finance.9 However, whereas previous criticisms highlighted how complex market players such as hedge funds ``fell between the cracks,'' our argument comes from a quite different angle. We explain how, given specific interdependencies between regulatory domains, the reflexivity of financial markets makes it imperative that these domains be governed as a whole. Yet global-level rule design is distributed over diverse organizations and neither the links between them, nor the umbrella provided by the Financial Stability Board, allow policymakers to integrate the substance of their standard-setting activities sufficiently.''

Indeed, a range of critics called for a continued decentralization of governance, mostly in order to allow financial rules to be better tailored to locally diverse economic and political contexts.''

\par
``Coordination between standard-setting bodies was a key concern at the G20's London summit in early 2009. Here the G20 decided to upgrade the Financial Stability Forum to the Financial Stability Board (FSB), with a permanent secretariat at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel. Following this upgrade, the FSB was formally mandated to coordinate at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard setting bodies (SSBs) in order to develop and promote the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies.48'' (M\"ugge and Perry, 2014, p. 204)  \% Strengthening of the FSB after the GFC
\par
``However, as Helleiner has pointed out, the FSB is in a weak position vis-\`a-vis standard setters; Lombardi echoes this conclusion.49 The underlying problem is that the FSB lacks ``hard'' instruments to elicit such coordination. However, it can use suasion behind the scenes, and wield influence via the progress reports it publishes on standard setting.50 The FSB can also count on the governments that sponsor its work to support coordination efforts between organizations that have those same governments as members. For these reasons, achieving cooperation between the BCBS and IOSCO is relatively unproblematic, and indeed has a long history. In contrast, the FSB is much less influential when one or more of the relevant bodies is not an intergovernmental organization (the IASB is not), or when key standards are not set multilaterally at all (those for credit rating agencies and derivatives trading are not).'' (M\"ugge and Perry, 2014, p. 204)  \% Role of the FSB vis-a-vis standard-setters

``In light of these deficiencies, it is unsurprising that we find no evidence that the FSB has succeeded in fostering greater coherence across the different regulatory domains addressed in this article (see column 3 of Table 1, above).51 On the contrary, at the outset the FSB's influence was strongly resisted by, among others, the IASB, explicitly concerning the notion that accounting standard setting might be drawn into a macroprudential agenda.52 In response, the FSB has since avoided involvement in substantive accounting debates, even though these are crucial to banking regulation and many of the other regulatory domains with which the FSB deals.''

\par
``Banking regulators are concerned with system-wide stability; accountants are focused on reporting the solvency and performance of individual banks.55 In concrete terms, banking regulators want rules that make banks hold enough capital to survive foreseeable trouble in the future, whereas accounting standard setters want banks to tell investors how well they are performing today. For these reasons, the BCBS is considerably more conservative than the accounting standard setters regarding the definition and valuation of capital.'' (M\"ugge and Perry, 2014, p. 205)
\par
``Unable to find a satisfactory compromise with accounting standard setters, the BCBS has, over the past two decades, sought to define the elements of bank capital more directly itself. The underlying data still come from accounting, but the BCBS has departed from the accountants' standard aggregates and instead constructed its own alternatives.56 Most notably, in order to ensure the common equity part of bank capital is of the ``highest quality,'' the BCBS has developed a special banking version of this aggregate. Whereas the IASB's and FASB's definitions of common equity are relatively broad,57 the BCBS version is narrowed by an extensive list of exclusions and adjustments.58'' (M\"ugge and Perry, 2014, p. 205)
\par
``Nevertheless, despite such efforts, there is still a strict limit as to how far the BCBS can insulate its capital standards from decisions taken by the accounting standard setters. This is because, as the crisis demonstrated, the most significant part of a bank's capital for absorbing losses comes from retained profits, which cannot be compiled without recourse to accounting aggregates.'' (M\"ugge and Perry, 2014, p. 205)
\par
``A second example of accounting standards disrupting the calibration of capital requirements is via measurement methods. The IASB and FASB continue to develop standards for financial assets that offer banks the scope to choose between two fundamentally different ways of measuring assets: historic cost and fair value.''

The BCBS, in contrast, has only been granted observer status,'' (M\"ugge and Perry, 2014, p. 208)

``Although much theoretical literature often highlights that HROs work together within \\
networks, and often assumes that this network improves the advocacy output of the \\
organizations, no existing study has explicitly examined this network of connections \\
between HROs. This article seeks to add to this theoretical literature by examining the \\
networks of relations and connections between these organizations. Two specific \\
questions are addressed. First, what explains the network of connections among \\
HROs? And, second, does an organization's position in the network matter for its \\
advocacy output? In other words, are organizations better able to advocate as a result \\
of this `curious grapevine?''' \\
(Murdie, 2013, p. 2)
\par
``Drawing on the cross-disciplinary literature on networks and collective action, I begin \\
with the assumption that being part of the network provides a set of tools for an \\
organization that is somewhat akin to a public good.5 This public good includes the \\
increased information, resources, and political clout that come from being connected to \\
other organizations also working for human rights improvement.'' \\
(Murdie, 2013, p. 2)
\par
``I argue that many factors hinder the ability of HROs to become connected, limiting the \\
density of the overall network. Forming network connections can be a costly endeavor, \\
too costly for many organizations outside of the global `North,' those with peripheral \\
interests, or those without standing with intergovernmental organizations (IGOs).7 Thus, \\
even though being part of the network provides tangible benefits for the organization and \\
even though all organizations could, in theory, be part of the network, not all HROs are \\
set up to take part in the HRO network. I'' \\
(Murdie, 2013, p. 2)
\par
``Finally, and at the real heart of the whole theoretical argument, I contend that network \\
characteristics of HROs are of real importance for their future advocacy output: because \\
they benefit from the public good of the HRO network, those organizations central to the \\
network are the organizations that should theoretically be more active in pressuring states \\
to change their human rights practices. Although the overall benefits of the network are \\
still felt by free-riders, I also contend that, because of a lack of reciprocity, these benefits \\
on advocacy output will be somewhat diminished for organizations that are more intense \\
free-riders'' \\

This introduction provides a new and more precise definition of the concept of regime complex.

The articles in this issue deepen the analytical understanding of complexes by examining concrete examples in various domains of global governance such as piracy, taxation, energy, food security, emissions reduction, carbon sinks, biosafety, and refugee governance. In addition to providing an in-depth description of a variety of different regime complexes, this issue is innovative on three accounts: (1) it presents complexes as both barriers and opportunities for global governance and gives explanations for these diverse outcomes; (2) it shows how a broad spectrum of actors is necessary for understanding the creation and evolution of complexes; and (3) it qualifies former claims to the effect that only powerful actors can impact regime complexes.},

This article argues that the ADB created a new AM because of institutional isomorphism, borrowing the idea of the AM from the World Bank as a result of coercive and mimetic isomorphic processes. Further, that the ADB introduced a mechanism ill-suited to the pre-existing (old) organizational culture of the ADB, which is based on consensus and hierarchical rule-following in the context of ADB operations to further economic growth while upholding state sovereignty. Despite its restructure and recent review, the mechanism's weakness was revealed through a stand-off between China and the AM over an investigation begun in 2009 (creating something `blue'). The paper concludes that the AM's ability to serve its purpose will remain hampered as long as ADB maintains consensus around economic growth and state sovereignty over providing recourse to affected people.},

We demonstrate that the network exhibits a significant level of cohesiveness, despite having evolved without any form of hierarchical control. Drawing on a social network analysis, we find a positive correlation among the sustainability performance of the firms, their membership in CSR schemes, and their network characteristics. We show that membership in multiple schemes and the firms' position in the CSR-schemes network constitute credible predictors of their sustainability performance, generating a separating equilibrium that distinguishes high from low CSR performers. We develop a model that explains the effectiveness of the CSR-schemes network based on the synergistic properties of the network and on a distinctive signaling dynamic. Our findings highlight the potential contribution of CSR to the resolution of global governance dilemmas.},

In many issue areas, global governance is increasingly fragmented among multiple international organizations (IOs). Existing work argues this fragmentation can undermine cooperation as different institutions adopt conflicting rules. However, this perspective overlooks the potential for interinstitutional coordination. I develop a theory of institutional deference: the acceptance of another IO's exercise of authority. By accepting rules crafted in another IO, member states can mitigate rule conflict and facilitate a division of labor within the regime complex. I use an original data set of over 2,000 IO policy documents to describe patterns of deference in the counterterrorism, intellectual property, and election-monitoring regime complexes. Empirical tests support two theoretical claims. First, institutional deference is indeed associated with a division of labor among institutions: IOs that defer to each other are more likely to focus their rule-making efforts on separate subissues. Second, deference is a strategic act that is shaped both by efficiency concerns and power politics. Statistical tests confirm that deference is used to efficiently pool resources among disparate organizations, and that IOs with weaker member states tend to defer to organizations with more powerful members.},

``When these options are infeasible, regulatory institutions in other contexts have turned to an alternative strategy: clarifying the scope of each body's regulatory authority to reduce jurisdictional overlap. Instead of adopting a single set of rules, this approach reduces rule conflict by establishing where ``each regulatory authority extend[s], and what should be done when these overlap.'''' (Pratt, 2018, p. 567)
\par
``When the potential for rule conflict arises, IOs engage in deference, defined as the acceptance of another IO's exercise of authority.'' (Pratt, 2018, p. 567)

``Examples of institutional deference are plentiful in international politics. I described earlier how UN Security Council members accepted the FATF's rules for terrorist finance rather than developing their own regulations. By doing so, the Council avoided setting multiple, potentially conflicting sets of rules.'' (Pratt, 2018, p. 567)
\par
``Deference can target specific issues where conflicting rules are particularly damaging, and it can be reversed if circumstances change.31 These characteristics make deference similar to other arrangements for sharing authority among global governance actors, such as delegation and orchestration.32 Like deference, delegation and orchestration occur when one actor grants another authority to pursue governance goals. However, two key differences distinguish deference from these related concepts.'' (Pratt, 2018, p. 568) \% Relationship between deference and delegation
\par
``First, deference emphasizes a different set of actors. In international relations, delegation has focused on how states (as principals) transfer authority to IOs (their agents). Orchestration theory focuses on how IOs mobilize third parties (primarily NGOs and rarely IOs) to aid their governance efforts. By contrast, deference occurs exclusively between IOs, as one organization accepts an exercise of authority by another.33'' (Pratt, 2018, p. 568)
\par
``A final conceptual question raised by deference is its potential to redistribute authority among IOs. Deference occurs whenever one IO accepts another organization's exercise of authority. In some cases, this acceptance simply reinforces existing authority relations among IOs.'' (Pratt, 2018, p. 569) \% Deference and power of an organization

If deference occurs between two IOs, the act should be reflected in the official corpus of documents that chronicle an institution's exercise of authority. Examining cases of deference that are formally documented facilitates measurement but also entails a cost. It excludes potential instances of ``deference by abstention,'' in which members states of one IO implicitly recognize the authority of another organization by declining to assert their own jurisdiction. Instead, this measurement strategy prioritizes ``deference by validation'' where one IO explicitly accepts an exercise of authority by another organization.37'' (Pratt, 2018, p. 570) \% Approach and limitations

While not all documents have the binding force of a formal treaty, they are useful vehicles for coordinating with other institutions on specific subissues.39 Each time an IO articulates obligations for member state behavior, it has an opportunity to defer to the rules of another organization.''

``To find relevant policy documents in these regime complexes, I first identified the set of IOs that participate in global governance of each issue. To be considered part of the regime complex, an IO must formally include the relevant issue in its institutional mandate or actively regulate state behavior in the issue area.40 Even with this criteria, there can be reasonable disagreement regarding which IOs participate in governance of a particular issue. A broad conception of intellectual property, for example, could encompass a wide range of related issues regulated by dozens of organizations.'' (Pratt, 2018, p. 571) \% Selection of organisations

``I parse each document with statistical software to see whether it makes reference to any other IO in the same regime complex. These cross-institutional references are then hand coded on a five-point scale, with ``1'' denoting a passing or irrelevant reference and ``5'' (deference) representing a clear acceptance of another IO's authority. The EU resolution discussed earlier makes reference to the OSCE, another organization involved in regulating electoral procedures. Specifically, it calls on relevant EU bodies to ensure that OSCE recommendations are ``fully and systematically integrated into all EU policy fields,''48 which is coded as an instance of deference.

``Third, these patterns of asymmetric deference reveal an informal hierarchy of authority among international institutions in a regime complex. Deference flows may either reinforce or restructure authority relations among IOs. If an informal IO grants deference to a formal, treaty-based organization, it reflects the pre-existing distribution of authority among institutions. If deference flows to less powerful IOs, or between institutions with similar levels of pre-existing authority, it can reshape governing authority in the regime complex.''

-  "I explore the practice of institutional deference: one IO's acceptance of another organization's exercise of authority.5 Deference is a frequent practice conducted by international organizations that operate in the same policy domain. In its most common form, member states of one organization formally adopt a set of rules established by a different institution, as exemplified by the Security Council's deference to the FATF. Other cases of deference are less formal, with member states altering an IO's operational routines, technical assistance programs, or monitoring systems to support the rules of another organization."

Why Defer? Jurisdictional Conflict Among IOs

\par
-  "Much of the literature on regime complexity focuses on the potential for rule conflict to undermine international cooperation. Inconsistent rules among IOs can raise a number of potential barriers to cooperation, including increasing uncertainty and raising transaction costs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/458HNYAZ?page=4}{Pratt 2018:564}) 

\par
-  "I briefly highlight two problems associated with inconsistent rules that have received significant attention: reduced compliance via regulatory arbitrage and inefficient duplication." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/458HNYAZ?page=4}{Pratt 2018:564})

\emph{\textbf{\#💬 \% Rational institutionalist interpretation of coordination among IOs}}
\par
\end{quotation}

\par
-  "Rational institutionalist theory argues that states create international institutions to generate gains from cooperation.19 This theory implies that states will recognize the costs associated with inconsistent rules and direct IOs to coordinate their rule-making efforts." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/458HNYAZ?page=6}{Pratt 2018:566}) 

\par
-  "These coordination efforts are common among IOs but have largely remained unexamined by scholars." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/458HNYAZ?page=6}{Pratt 2018:566}) 

\par
-  "Faced with the potential for arbitrage and duplication, IO member states have incentives to prevent inconsistent rules. Two potential remedies are harmonization of IO rules or the formal unification of disparate institutions" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/458HNYAZ?page=6}{Pratt 2018:566}) 

\par
-  "When these options are infeasible, regulatory institutions in other contexts have turned to an alternative strategy: clarifying the scope of each body's regulatory authority to reduce jurisdictional overlap. Instead of adopting a single set of rules, this approach reduces rule conflict by establishing where "each regulatory authority extend[s], and what should be done when these overlap."" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/458HNYAZ?page=7}{Pratt 2018:567}) 

\par
-  "When the potential for rule conflict arises, IOs engage in deference, defined as the acceptance of another IO's exercise of authority." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/458HNYAZ?page=7}{Pratt 2018:567}) 

\par
-  "Examples of institutional deference are plentiful in international politics. I described earlier how UN Security Council members accepted the FATF's rules for terrorist finance rather than developing their own regulations. By doing so, the Council avoided setting multiple, potentially conflicting sets of rules." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/458HNYAZ?page=7}{Pratt 2018:567})

-  "Deference can target specific issues where conflicting rules are particularly damaging, and it can be reversed if circumstances change.31 These characteristics make deference similar to other arrangements for sharing authority among global governance actors, such as delegation and orchestration.32 Like deference, delegation and orchestration occur when one actor grants another authority to pursue governance goals. However, two key differences distinguish deference from these related concepts." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/458HNYAZ?page=8}{Pratt 2018:568}) 

\par
-  "First, deference emphasizes a different set of actors. In international relations, delegation has focused on how states (as principals) transfer authority to IOs (their agents). Orchestration theory focuses on how IOs mobilize third parties (primarily NGOs and rarely IOs) to aid their governance efforts. By contrast, deference occurs exclusively between IOs, as one organization accepts an exercise of authority by another.33" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/458HNYAZ?page=8}{Pratt 2018:568})

I argue that a regime complex will have contrasting effects depending on the degree of differentiation among institutions. In issue areas where institutions function as substitutes, forum shopping by states will generally reduce the degree of policy adjustment achieved in the regime. However, in issue areas where institutions are vertically differentiated\textemdash i.e., institutions with deeper rules provide greater value to states\textemdash a regime complex can increase policy change. I demonstrate these dynamics formally and provide empirical evidence in a comparative analysis of the development finance and election-monitoring regime complexes.},

The international governance of derivatives markets is a notable case of this phenomenon in finance because a variety of post-crisis rules have been issued by a multitude of international standard-setting bodies. By combining the regime complexity and orchestration frameworks, we explain the precision and scope of international standards for derivatives trade reporting. We show how a collective orchestrator (the Group of Twenty) and a hub intermediary (the Financial Stability Board) managed regime complexity through the orchestration of the available intermediaries. We also seek to refine the orchestration framework by explaining how the mechanism of issue de-linkage can be used to manage the partly diverging goals among states within the collective orchestrator. Our findings are relevant for the global regulation and governance of other policy areas characterized by a multiplicity of actors and interlinked issues, such as trade, energy, and environmental policy.},

-  "nternational regime complexity has become a prominent phenomenon in world politics and the global economy (Abbott \& Snidal 2012; Alter \& Meunier 2009; Alter and Raustiala 2018; Johnson \& Urpelainen 2012; Orsini et al. 2013; Pratt 2018). Scholars have identified regime complexes in a variety of policy areas, ranging from climate change (Keohane \& Victor 2011; Widerberg \& Pattberg 2017), intellectual property rights (Urpelainen \& van de Graaf 2015), trade (Alter \& Meunier 2006), and the Troika in dealing with the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area (Henning 2017). However, internationalfinance has mostly been overlooked by the literature on regime complexity so far (with the exceptions of Heldt \& Schmidtke 2019; Breen et al. 2020; Quaglia 2020). Yet, regime complexity increased considerably infinance after the 2008 crisis, particularly in areas, such as derivatives markets, which were not subject to public regulation previously."

Whereas, eventually, a new international regime for trade reporting was successfully put in place less than a decade after the crisis, there was uneven progress in the precision and scope of the three main components of the international standards for trade reporting, namely: (i) the harmonization of data formats; (ii) the issuing of global identifiers; and (iii) data access and cross-border data sharing. The research question in our article is to explain this varied empirical pattern, which ranges from the successful setting up of a system of global identifiers to almost no agreement on data sharing, with data formatting in between.

-  "First, the literature on regime complexity has emphasized important downsides of this phenomenon, such as inefficient governance outcomes in terms of rule overlap, redundancies, and inconsistencies, as well as undesirable opportunities for forum shopping and regulatory arbitrage. By contrast, we show that regime complexity in derivatives trade reporting was managed at relatively low setup costs through the orchestration of available expertise among existing standard-setting bodies, which issued different interconnected rules. Second, we contribute to the literature on orchestration by investigating the case of a collective orchestrator, multiple intermediaries, and multiple orchestration targets, and their implications for the precision and scope of the adopted international standards. We identify the presence of a hub intermediary that manages the partly diverging goals of states in the collective orchestrator and aligns the work of a multitude of organizations involved in the regime complex. We also identify a new mechanism, issue de-linkage, which is instrumental in managing goal divergence among states in the orchestration process."

-  "because the O often lacks authoritative control over I and T (Abbott et al. 2015, p. 9, see also Abbott et al. 2020). Orchestration occurs when an O, "enlists and supports" an I to address a T in "pursuit of the governance goals" of the O. An O lacks some governance capabilities and, therefore, brings a third party to act as I between itself and the T, rather than trying to govern the T directly. Apart from unitary Os, there can be "multiple" Os, or "collective" Os, which are composed of multiple actors. For instance, several IGOs, such as the Group of Twenty (G20), are collective Os, comprised of different states (Abbott et al. 2020, p. 14). Multiple and collective Os raise the challenge of how to reconcile the diverging goals of states represented in the O on various issues. One way of doing so is through issue linkage, which is well explored by the literature. Another way is through issue de-linkage, as elaborated below. An I has governance capabilitiessuch as expertise, material resources, and direct access to Tswhich the O does not have. An I collaborates because it shares the O's governance goals and values its support. An O may enlist as I transgovernmental networks, other international organizations, NGOs, and private actors (e.g. business organizations). The Ts of orchestration may be either states or private actors" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NY9FL72P?page=4}{Quaglia and Spendzharova 2021:4})

-  "First, we develop the concept of hub intermediary (see Fig. 1), which we define as an international body actively leading the orchestration process, seeking to align the work of other Is and facilitating the division of labor among Is in the regime complex. The concept of hub intermediary adds to the orchestration theory by exploring the relationships between multiple Is. A hub intermediary can be identified empirically as a key node in the interaction between the O and other Is. It parcels out the tasks to be accomplished among the relevant Is when the O only issues broad guidance on the general goals. The hub intermediary is different from a lower level O in a chain of indirect governance because the O has no immediate link to the Tsonly Is work directly with Ts (Abbott et al. 2015, p. 5)- and a hub intermediary is also directly linked to Ts. Furthermore, a hub intermediary has institutional proximity to the O and possesses crucial capabilities (such as expertise, established contacts, administrative resources) that the O lacks. In sum, we expect that if there is a collective O and multiple Is, a hub intermediary can contribute to managing regime complexity by aligning the work of the other Is and crafting mutually acceptable solutions."

-  "We define issue delinkage as the separation of the more controversial issues from the less controversial ones in the regime complex in order to agree upon international standards acceptable to all parties. The underlying mechanism is the same as with issue linkages. Importantly for our analysis, the institutional setting has an influence on the division of labor among the different intermediaries and the coordination of their activities. On the one hand, issue de-linkage helps to solve the partial goal divergences among states in the collective O. On the other hand, it helps to align the work of the multiple Is. We detect issue de-linkage empirically when an actor in the regime complex actively separates the more controversial policy issues from the less controversial ones. It then crafts an international standard acceptable to the negotiating parties regarding the less controversial issues, while leaving the more controversial ones for alternative venues or further rounds of negotiation. In sum, we expect that if there is a collective O and multiple Is, issue de-linkage can help to manage regime complexity by identifying areas of possible compromise, especially if there are partly diverging goals among states within the collective O."

At the same time, we identify several important regulatory problems that the O could not solve by itself because of its limited institutional capabilities, focus on issuing broad guidelines rather than concrete international standards, and instances of goal divergence among its member jurisdictions (Rixen \& Viola 2020" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/NY9FL72P?page=6}{Quaglia and Spendzharova 2021:6})

The G20 does not even have a permanent secretariat, unlike international standard-setting bodies, such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Instead, secretarial support is provided ad-hoc by the rotating presidency (Kirton 2016). The G20 meets at the Leaders level once a year (twice a year during thefinancial crisis and its aftermath) and does not issue either hard of soft law (unlike international standard-setting bodies, discussed below). Its main (formal) outputs are the communiques issued after the summits. Although the G20 meetings are preceded by extensive preparation, such as workshops, reports, and case studies on specific subjects, much of this preparatory work is not conducted in-house. Instead, the production of technical information for the G20 is carried out by experts in national capitals, international standard-setting bodies, and internationalfinancial institutions (Cooper \& Thakur 2013; Posner 2015). According to the orchestration approach, governance actors are more likely to orchestrate when they lack certain capabilities needed to achieve their goals through other governance modesthis is the case with the G20."

-  "to trade repositories (agenda-setting). The G20 asked the FSB to take the lead by preparing recommendations for the "appropriate governance framework," "representing the public interest" for a global LEI (G20 2011). Then, the G20 (2012) at the Los Cabos Summit endorsed the FSB's recommendations for the development of a global LEI system to be launched by March 2013 (endorsement). Afterwards, the G20 remained the main O, maintaining political pressure for reforms and relying on the FSB to carry out all the policy coordination needed to align the work of all other intermediaries involved in the orchestration. For example, the G20 Hangzhou summit in 2016 reiterated the commitment to "remove legal and regulatory barriers to the reporting of OTC derivatives to trade repositories and to authorities' appropriate access to data" (G20 2016). However, this was done with some discontinuity and by devoting a limited space tofinancial regulation on the G20 agenda, becausefinance had become less politically salient (Viola 2014). The G20 also periodically asked Is (that is to say, international standard-setters infinance), to report progress on the work that they were carrying out (reporting). For example, for thefirst 3 years after the crisis, the FSB submitted to the G20 an annual Report on the Progress in the Implementation of the G20 Recommendations for Strengthening Financial Stability. 3 Afterwards, once a year, the FSB's chair sent a letter to the G20 onfinancial reforms and prepared annual Reports on the Implementation of G20 Financial Regulatory Reforms for the G20 summits."

To begin with, the CPSS, which was established in 1990 and was renamed as the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures in 2014 (CPMI), brings together central bankers. The IOSCO, established in 1989, brings together securities markets regulators. The FSB brings together central bankers,financial regulators, and treasury ministry officials from the G20 countries.4 It also includes representatives from all other international standard-setting bodies (the CPSS/CPMI, the IOSCO, the BCBS, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, the International Accounting Standards Board), as well as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the World Bank, the IMF, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Furthermore, a new I, the Global LEI Foundation, was established and a non-financial international standard-setter, the International Standardization Organization (ISO), issued rules on the LEI code.

-  "To begin with, the FSB was well positioned to act as a hub intermediary in the international governance of derivative trade reporting. Established by the G20 in the wake of the internationalfinancial crisis in 2009, the FSB built on the work of its predecessor, the Financial Stability Forum, to promote internationalfinancial stability by coordinating the actions of different nationalfinancial authorities and international standard-setting bodies (Donnelly 2012; Posner 2015). With hyperbole, the FSB was described by US Treasury Minister Geithner as a novel "fourth pillar" of the global economic architecture, alongside the IMF, World Bank, and World Trade Organization (Helleiner 2010). In fact, the FSB was more of a transmission mechanism between the G20 and international standard-setters composed of domestic regulators (Pagliari 2013b). Helleiner (2010) notes that the Charter of the FSB gave this body a specific mandate to "promote and help coordinate the alignment of the activities" of international standard setters and to "undertake joint strategic reviews" of their work to ensure it was "timely, coordinated, focused on priorities and addressing gaps," while respecting other bodies' mandates and independence. Following the 2009 Pittsburgh Summit, the G20 put the FSB in charge of coordinating the formulation and implementation of OTCDs reforms (Donnelly 2012). Applying the O-I-T model, Figure 1 summarizes the main G20 summits guiding the reforms of derivatives trade reporting and the subsequent policy actions of the Is, coordinated by the hub intermediary (FSB). Since there was a collective O and multiple Is, the FSB emerged as a hub intermediary due to its institutional proximity to the O (the G20) and a variety of resources, such as technical expertise and administrative capacity, in particular, a highly professional secretariat experienced in working with both the G20 jurisdictions and with other international standard setting bodies. Moreover, representatives of other Is (such as the BCBS, the CPMI, the IOSCO) have a permanent seat in the FSB, which facilitates its work in organizing and aligning the work of other relevant Is in the regime complex. As we show below, the FSB also took the lead in translating the broad G20 intentions and guidance into concrete international standards. Moreover, given the mixture of agreement and disagreement among states affected by the proposed international standards, issue de-linkage by the hub intermediary was instrumental in identifying potential areas of agreement and managing regime complexity. The FSB played an important overall coordination role. It fostered a deliberate division of labor amongst the international standard-setting bodies, facilitated by the fact that the FSB included representatives from all other relevant international standard-setting bodies (for a similar interpretation, see Brummer 2015, p. 70). To understand how the FSB made a difference in crafting mutually acceptable international standards, it is worth considering that early reform efforts, such as the initial work of the CPSS-IOSCO (2012b) to develop Principles on Financial Market Infrastructures did not lead to much progress. This report bundled together all the main components of trade reporting, that is to say, issues concerning global identifiers, other critical data formatting, and cross-border data sharing. The report overestimated the incentives that market actors would have to establish systems of global identifiers, it underestimated the complexity of harmonizing other critical data for regulators, and, importantly, it overlooked the political and legal obstacles to data sharing among jurisdictions. Upon realizing the lack of progress, the G20 called upon the FSB to give further impetus to international standard-setting in this area.

Finally, the FSB took upon itself the work on cross-border data sharing, which was complicated by the fact that trade repositories were "usually subject to professional secrecy requirements, including relevant confidentiality/privacy/data protection laws" and that they often could "transmit data only to domestic authority(ies)" (FSB 2014, p. 20; 2018b)."

Despite the rapid proliferation of institutions, scholars continue to embrace the assumption that individual regimes are decomposable from others. We contend that an increasingly common phenomenon is the "regime complex:" a collective of partially overlapping and nonhierarchical regimes. The evolution of regime complexes reflects the influence of legalization on world politics. Regime complexes are laden with legal inconsistencies because the rules in one regime are rarely coordinated closely with overlapping rules in related regimes. Negotiators often attempt to avoid glaring inconsistencies by adopting broad rules that allow for multiple interpretations. In turn, solutions refined through implementation of these rules focus later rounds of negotiation and legalization. We explore these processes using the issue of plant genetic resources (PGR). Over the last century, states have created property rights in these resources in a Demsetzian process: as new technologies and ideas have made PGR far more valuable, actors have mobilized and clashed over the creation of property rights that allow the appropriation of that value.},

Deepeners are states that are dissatisfied with the slow pace of cooperation and join institutions to support cooperation, while fragmenters are states dissatisfied with the quick pace and join institutions to undermine cooperation. I evaluate my argument using new data on sixty-three climate institutions and states' greenhouse gas mitigation targets in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. I find that membership in climate institutions designed to facilitate implementation is associated with more ambitious targets, while membership in general is unrelated to targets.},

We illustrate the usefulness of this approach through an empirical case: the diffusion of participatory governance arrangements among IOs from 1970 to 2010. The analysis shows that connectivity among IOs contributes to convergence, which typically is manifested through imitation of very specific institutional models.

Global governance provides ample opportunities for diffusion as IOs have grown in number, often overlap in membership, and increasingly occupy the same policy domain within international regime complexes. This intuition is supported by the handful of empirical studies that currently make up existing research on diffusion across IOs.8 However, these studies are almost exclusively qualitative and focused on regional integration. While important contributions to the field, they do not allow for an assessment of general dynamics of diffusion in global governance'' (Sommerer and Tallberg, 2019, p. 400) \% State of the literature on the diffusion across IOs
\par
``The principal conclusions from this empirical case are three-fold. First, interconnectedness among IOs has contributed to a diffusion of participatory governance arrangements. Specifically, IOs tend to copy models from organizations with which they share partnerships and issue-area orientation. It matters less if IOs have overlapping memberships, are based in the same region, or are headquartered next to each other. This finding suggests that cross-IO diffusion operates somewhat differently from cross-country diffusion, where ``the classic story ... is about geography, with policies spreading from one neighbour to the next'' (Sommerer and Tallberg, 2019, p. 401) \% Findings on the determinants of diffusion among IOs

\par
``As the number of IOs in world politics has increased, so has the interconnectedness among them. IOs are not atomistic organizations, each minding its own business in a well-defined governance space, but often interlinked and overlapping in functional or geographical scope. This is the basic insight behind multiple strands of research in recent years. Literature on institutional interplay and regime complexes explores the nature, management, and consequences of interactions among international regimes and organizations'' (Sommerer and Tallberg, 2019, p. 402) \% Growing in the interconnectedness among IOs
\par
``In our account, interconnectedness among IOs is central because it affects the level of diffusion we can expect. The idea is simple: diffusion is more likely to take place between IOs with a high level of connectivity than between IOs with few links, interactions, and commonalities. When IOs are highly interconnected, this provides greater opportunities for information, ideas, models, and norms to travel across IOs, giving rise to patterns of convergence in policies and institutions. Connections among IOs thus function as pathways or channels for diffusion in global governance.'' (Sommerer and Tallberg, 2019, p. 404) \% Interconnectedness among IOs as driver of diffusion
\par
``While we speak of diffusion across IOs as if they were unitary actors, the real agents of convergence are the member state bodies (committees, councils, summits) and supranational bodies (secretariats, courts, parliamentary assemblies) mandated to make decisions on the policies and designs of IOs'' (Sommerer and Tallberg, 2019, p. 404) \% Drivers of diffusion among IOs
\par
``First, as already recognized, IOs may be linked through their memberships. Global IOs often have extensive overlaps in membership, as do IOs located in the same world region. Since states are the principal decision makers in IOs, adopting or rejecting new policies and institutions, overlap in membership provides a potentially powerful channel of diffusion.40 In this logic, states draw on information gained in one IO when confronted with a similar policy or design choice in another. One illustration is the compliance system of the Montreal Protocol on ozone depletion, which states with overlapping membership subsequently used as a model for the Kyoto Protocol on climate change.41'' (Sommerer and Tallberg, 2019, p. 406) \% Connections among IOs via membership
\par
``Second, IOs may be organizationally linked to each other through institutional arrangements. It has become relatively common that IOs recognize each other's existence, mutuality of interests, and functional interconnectedness by engaging in official partnerships.42 For example, the EU's department for humanitarian aid has formal partnership agreements with the International Organization on Migration, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the World Health Organization.43 A common component of such partnerships is mutual observer status. For instance, the World Trade Organization (WTO) offers observer status to the UN, OECD, and World Bank, while the African Union (AU) lists a dozen regional and global IOs as accredited partners. Partnerships may also be operational, such as the cooperation between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and EU in security policy.44'' (Sommerer and Tallberg, 2019, p. 406) \% Connections among IOs via institutional arrangements
\par
``IOs active in the same issue area normally have commonalities in the societal problems they address and the policy options they confront. When choosing from the menu of models, we expect them to look specifically at the policies and institutions of other IOs in the same issue area\textemdash their functional reference group. In the area of regional integration, it is well-known that IOs have adopted designs and policies with an eye to models in other parts of the world.46 Likewise, development banks are known to have sought inspiration from each other in developing their policies and organizational structures,47 as have regional fisheries-management organizations.48'' (Sommerer and Tallberg, 2019, p. 407) Informal ties among IOs based on issue-area

``Imitation, then, refers to the existence of similar participatory arrangements among the same type of IO bodies, where similarity is defined as the exact same combination of depth and range of access. Adaptation captures convergence among the same type of IO bodies to arrangements with varying levels of depth and range of access. In this case IOi adapts a model from IOj to its own needs through modifications.72 Inspiration, finally, refers to the adoption of a participatory model from a different type of body in IOj. In this case, it is the general idea or norm of participatory governance that diffuses rather than body-specific models.73 Inspiration is uniquely well suited to capture such a diffuse convergence effect, since it goes beyond the functional imperatives of specific types of bodies'' (Sommerer and Tallberg, 2019, p. 415) \% Types of diffusion

``Second, IOs are frequently connected through institutional arrangements. We capture all types of official relations at the general level of IOs in our variable PARTNERSHIP. It builds on data from the Yearbook of International Organization,79 which provides information on bilateral arrangements such as observer status, partnership agreements, memoranda of understanding, and other forms of cooperation. Since the data are based on self-reporting by IOs, and the terms depend on the language used in a particular IO, we merge all yearbook categories into a binary variable. This type of connectivity is less common. At the end of our observation period, only 7.8 percent of all IO dyads reported such a relation. Partnership-based linkages were slightly more frequent in earlier years, suggesting that a longer history for an IO increases the likelihood of such links (10.5\% in 1990).''

``Fifth, IOs may be linked to each other through their social reference group, conceptualized as geographical proximity. We construct the variable SAME HEADQUARTER LOCATION by extracting information on IO headquarters from the Yearbook of International Organization, and by assigning a score of 1 if the distance within the dyad is less than 100 miles. This type of connectivity is rare, with only 2.3 percent of all IO dyads in 2010 having their headquarters in close proximity, like the IMF and OAS in Washington DC.''

This practice presents a puzzle: conventional wisdom suggests that states should use existing institutions to minimize the transaction costs of co-operation. This article proposes a bargaining approach to explain the               de novo               creation of overlapping international institutions. In this model, a dissatisfied `challenger' state threatens to create a new institution, and a `defender' state can propose to reform the currently focal institution. Overlapping institutions are created when the currently focal institution is (1) captured by interests opposed to the challenger and (2) domestic political pressure to abandon the status quo is intense. Similar to models of deterrence, the expectation that the new institution garners support among third parties is irrelevant for the equilibrium likelihood of               de novo               creation.

  abstract = {This article introduces a new dataset on transnational public-private governance initiatives (TGIs) in world politics. TGIs are institutions in which states and/or intergovernmental organizations cooperate with business and civil society actors to govern transnational problems. Thus, they are a special type of transnational public-private partnership. TGIs have flourished since the late 1990s and, today, govern a broad range of global policy domains, including environmental protection, human rights, health, trade, finance, and security. Yet, existing research lacks the data necessary to map this phenomenon and its variation along dimensions, such as issue areas, governance functions, participation, and institutional design. The Transnational Public-Private Governance Initiatives in World Politics (TGIWP) data is designed for this purpose. It contains detailed information on the scope, functions, participants, and institutional design of 636 TGIs created between 1885 and 2017. I describe the sample generation and discuss coding rules. I also map the proliferation and characteristics of TGIs, and provide an exploratory analysis of the relationship between state participation in TGIs and domestic democracy to show how the new data contributes to enhancing ongoing debates in international relations. The article concludes by discussing how the new dataset may be useful in future research on global governance.},

-  "An 'institutional complex' comprises all institutions governing an issue area in global governance. The concept emerged from empirical observations of proliferating international and transnational global governance institutions, making the study of isolated single regimes - defined as subsets of international institutions that constrain state-behaviour (Oberth\"ur and Stokke, 2011, p.2) - untenable. In global climate governance, for example, the UNFCCC has been complemented by hundreds of public, private and hybrid institutions demanding authority on a variety of issues (Keohane and Victor, 2011; Bulkeley et al., 2012). '[I]nternational regime complexity', write Alter and Meunier (2009, p.13), 'refers to the presence of nested, partially overlapping, and parallel international regimes that are not hierarchically ordered'. Institutional complexity is, thus, a quality of institutional complexes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/F2H6P52H?page=2}{Widerberg 2016:23})

Moreover, attempts to display the regime complex of an issue area have generally resulted in crude visualizations of little analytical value beyond heuristics (e.g. Keohane and Victor, 2011; Zelli, 2011). Finally, studies starting from regime theory have largely remained silent on the interaction between the emerging landscape of non-state public and private actors on the one hand, and the international, state-dominated level on the other."

International regime theory has made important strides in identifying different types of dyadic interactions and relations between individual institutions, predominantly examining the interplay between norms and rules. However, it is possible to conceive of a large number of other relationships and connections such as shared memberships, information exchange or discursive interactions between institutions. Third, the methods used for mapping institutional complexes to date provide few tools to compare the degree of fragmentation across issue areas in a replicable and valid manner. In particular when the number of institutions exceeds a certain threshold, qualitative and in-depth analysis of institutional complexity become difficult to manage and call for a methodology apt for larger data sets."

-  "For this chapter's purposes, I assume that the analytical glue binding institutions together to form an institutional complex are the material and functional linkages to the issue area itself. Measuring the degree of fragmentation then requires us to identify overlap between the institutions forming an institutional complex. By conceptualizing institutional complexes as networks I explicitly focus on the relationships between institutions. Institutional complexity can then be examined as a global property of the network and allows for network analysis to compare structures in different institutional complexes and compute the degree of fragmentation. It also enables us to draw insights from applications of network analysis in a wide range of disciplines such as computer science, biology, economics, sociology and, increasingly, international relations (Kahler, 2009; Hafner-Burton et al., 2009)."

-  "Most authors seem to have taken densification for granted without much discussion on how to measure it. Among the rare conceptual approaches to the term, one can roughly discern two understandings of density: increases in the sheer number of institutions, and increases in functional overlaps between institutions. Morin and Orsini (2013) suggest that regime complexes are expected to densify over time because the efforts of managing this complexity will involve further institutional processes such as negotiation and implementation. Testing their claim however, would require a measure of density in institutional complexes. Moreover, changes in density could have important repercussions for the functioning of the institutional complex. Abbott and colleagues (2014), for instance, argue from an organizational ecology perspective that the degree of institutional density determines the competition for resources in the population of arrangements. Others have suggested that large numbers of institutions negatively impact actors without the capacity to sustain negotiations in multiple fora (Brown Weiss, 1993, p. 697). Hence, the density of the institutional complex could prove an important structural variable for explaining the possibility for actors to engage in global governance as well as the problem-solving capacity of the institutional complex."

\par
-  "To explore these arguments on the role of different actors it is essential to identify key players in institutional complexes. For identifying central actors in a network several measures of centrality are available. Degree centrality, for instance, measures how many connections an actor has and provides a crude measure of status in the network and level of activity. An actor with many connections could be considered more engaged in the institutional complex than others. Betweenness centrality measures to what extent a node is vital to the transactions between other nodes. An actor with high betweenness centrality could, for example, act as a bridge between different actors or groups of actors and thus facilitate (or obstruct) exchanges. Such 'bridging organizations' have been identified as potentially important actors to manage fragmentation (Gupta et al., 2015)."

The degree distribution also follows a power law suggesting that the network has scale-free properties. These types of networks are characterized by the presence of a few nodes that have far above average degree, also called hubs. These nodes are probable candidates for taking up central positions in the network, for instance, by connecting different clusters."

  abstract = {Abstract             The empirical changes in global financial governance (GFG) and China's position in it, against the backdrop of the 2008 global financial crisis and China's economic rise in recent decades, suggest two plausible conclusions: (1) the present GFG system has been significantly reformed and improved by forming a networked architecture and a regime complex; (2) China's economic rise has automatically extended to China's rise in GFG, embodying its full integration into the architecture and regime. This article constructs a three-dimensional international political economy (IPE) analytical framework to reexamine the two conclusions and thus finds two illusions: an increasingly widespread\textemdash or rising\textemdash illusion of a much improved and more stable GFG system and an illusion of China's rising in GFG via an automatic transformation from economic might to governance power. The ``rising illusion'' of a much-improved GFG risks resulting in a reform dilemma, while the illusion of China's rise in GFG risks escalating the China-US and, more broadly, emerging-dominant states conflicts into full-scale confrontation. The prevalence of these two illusions highlights the need for greater attention from academic and policy spheres to relevant issues.},

  abstract = {The increasing density and entanglement of international law and institutions leads to a growing potential for collisions between norms and rules emanating from different international institutions. It is an open question, however, when actors actually create manifest conflicts about overlapping norms and rules and how \textendash{} and with what consequences \textendash{} such conflicts are handled. We therefore utilize the concept of ``interface conflicts'' in which two or more actors express positional differences over the scope or prevalence of different international norms. Building on the findings of the DFG research group OSAIC (Overlapping Spheres of Authority and Interface Conflicts), we introduce the Interface Conflicts 1.0 dataset, which assembles information on 78 interface conflicts. The dataset provides information on the actors and norms at stake in interface conflicts and focuses specifically on their subsequent handling. It distinguishes co-operative from non-cooperative conflict management, and codes the institutional as well as distributional outcomes of all management efforts. Drawing on the Interface Conflicts 1.0 dataset, the paper discusses first descriptive statistics regarding the bones of contention in interface conflicts, distributions across types of conflict management, and conflict management effects on the legal and institutional arrangements in the areas at stake. We thus contribute empirical building blocks to debates about global (dis)order and open new avenues for future research.},

-  "Outstanding contributions have pointed to the dark side of this development. Both International Law (IL) and International Relations (IR) scholars have worked a lot on the assumption that this "fragmentation" or "international regime complexity" undermines international law and order. In IL, the view that colliding international legal regimes undermine the integrity of international law is prevalent (Benvenisti and Downs 2007; Dunoff and Trachtman 2009; cf. Peters 2017). Many IR analysts share this view and contend that institutional overlap creates opportunities for "forumshopping" and "regime-shifting" that allow, especially the most powerful states, to evade international obligations (Drezner 2009, 2013; Helfer 2009; Morse and Keohane 2014). However, there is another side to the coin. Some analysts emphasize the functionality of institutional complexity (e.g. Keohane and Victor 2011) or highlight the potential normative benefits arising from inter-institutional contestation (Faude and Gro\ss e-Kreul 2020)."

-  ", while studies about the rising contestation of international authority by now also rely on quantitative data, the research program on regime complexity and international legal fragmentation is lagging behind in this respect. In IR, respective studies have mostly been issue-area or problem-field specific, and largely based on single or small-N comparative case studies (see e.g. Raustiala and Victor 2004; Betts 2013; Abbott 2012" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5GT3QKMG?page=7}{Z\"urn, Kreuder-Sonnen and Fu\ss{} 2021:7})

-  "Our core unit of analysis is what we call interface conflicts, that is, those norm collisions in the global realm that are perceived or constructed by actors and expressed in positional differences. We thus take an internalist approach to the identification of conflict that allows a focus on those normative inconsistencies that have actual social consequences. Concentrating on cases in which actors justify their incompatible positions with reference to competing international norms or rules allows us to exclude "false positives", that is, instances in which observers treat overlapping institutions as conflicting whereas the involved actors do not. One example might be the overlap between the World Bank and the newly created Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB), which has widely been treated as conflictual. Upon closer inspection, however, actors seem to perceive the institutions as complementary rather than contradictory (Faude and Fuss 2020)."
